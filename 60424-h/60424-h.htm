<p class='c008'>The object of this Treatise is to exhibit the chemical
principles of the art of making good and wholesome
Bread, of Wheat, Oats, Rye, Barley, Rice,
Potatoes, and other farinaceous substances used for
this purpose in different parts of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have first taken a view of the chemical constitution
of the Alimentary Substances derived from the
vegetable kingdom, and have added an Historical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ii'>ii</span>Sketch of the Art of Making Bread. I have elucidated
the chemical constitution of the substances of
which Bread is made among civilized nations, as well
as of various nutritive materials, besides Bread Corn,
which are used in different countries as substitutes
for Bread.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have described the chemical analysis of Bread
Flour, its immediate constituent parts, their proportions
in different kinds of grain, and the method of
separating them. I have pointed out the materials
more particularly fitted for the fabrication of Bread;
I have explained the reason why a variety of Alimentary
Farinaceous Seeds, in common use, cannot be
made into light and porous loaf-bread, although they
are well calculated, under other forms, of being converted
into highly nutritious food.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_iii'>iii</span>I have explained the chemical distinction which
exists between bread made with yeast, as well as
with leaven, and bread made without either of
these species of ferment; and, lastly, I have given
specific directions for making the different kinds of
Bread prepared from Wheat, Oats, Rye, Barley,
Rice, Maize, Buck-wheat, Potatoes, and other farinaceous
substances, as practised in various countries.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>To most animals nature has designed a
limited range of aliment, when compared to
the extensive choice allotted to man. If
we look into the history of the human race,
inhabiting the different parts of the globe,
as far as we are acquainted with it, we
find, that man appears to be designed
by nature to eat of all substances that are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>capable of nourishing him: fruits, grains,
roots, herbs, flesh, fish, reptiles, and fowls,
all contribute to his sustenance. He can
even subsist on every variety of these substances,
under every mode of preparation,
dried, preserved in salt, hardened in smoke,
pickled in vegetable acids, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Author of Nature has so constructed
our organs of digestion, that we can accommodate
ourselves to every species of aliment;
no kind of food injures us; we are
capable of being habituated to every species,
and of converting into nutriment almost
every production of nature.</p>

<p class='c009'>When we enquire more minutely into the
chemical constitution of the different alimentary
materials, which promote the growth,
support the strength, and renew the waste
of our body, we find that animal substances
are not suited to form the whole of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>our daily food; and that, in fact, if long
and extensively used, their stimulating
effects at length exhausts and debilitates
the system, which it at first invigorated and
supported. Those, accordingly, who have
lived for any great length of time on a diet
composed entirely of animal matter, become
oppressed, heavy, and indolent, the
tone and excitability of their frame are impaired,
they are affected with indigestion,
the breathing is hurried on the smallest exercise,
the gums become spongy, the breath
is fœtid, and the limbs swell. We recognize
in this description the approach of
scurvy, a disease familiar to sailors, to the
inhabitants of besieged towns, and, in
general, to all who are wholly deprived of
a just proportion of vegetable aliment.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the other hand, vegetable food being
less stimulating is also less nourishing; besides,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>this kind of aliment is, upon the
whole, of more difficult assimilation than the
food derived from the animal kingdom.
Hence it is, perhaps, that nature has provided
a greater extent of digestive organs
for animals wholly herbivorous. It is insufficient
to raise the human system to all the
strength and vigour of which it is susceptible.
Flatulency of the stomach, muscular
and nervous debility, and a long series of
disorders, are not unfrequently the consequences
of this too sparing diet. Some
Eastern nations, indeed, live almost entirely
on vegetable substances; but these, it is remarked,
are seldom so robust, so active, or
so brave, as men who live on a mixed diet
of animal and vegetable food. Few, at
least, in the countries of Europe can be
sufficiently nourished by vegetable food
alone; and even those nations, and individuals,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>who are said to live exclusively
on vegetables, because they do not eat the
flesh of animals, generally make use of milk
at least, of eggs, and butter and cheese.</p>

<p class='c009'>Food composed of animal and vegetable
materials is, in truth, that which is best
suited to the nature and condition of man.
The proportions in which these should be
used it is not easy to determine, but generally
the quantity of vegetables should exceed
that of animal food. “On this head,”
says Dr. Fothergill, “I have only one short
caution to give. Those who think it necessary
to pay any attention to their health, at
table, should take care that the quantity of
bread, of meat, and of pudding, and of
greens, should not compose, each of them,
a meal, as if some only were thrown in to
make weight, but carefully to observe that
the sum of, altogether, do not exceed due
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>bounds or incroach upon the first feeling
of satiety.”</p>

<p class='c009'>All the products of the vegetable kingdom,
used as aliment, are not equally nutritious.
When we contemplate with a chemical
eye the nutritive principles contained
in vegetable substances, we soon perceive
that they are but few in number, namely,
starch, gluten, mucilage, jelly, fixed oil,
sugar, and acids; and the different vegetable
parts of them are nutritious, wholesome,
and digestible, according to the nature
and proportion of their principles contained
in them. The starch and gluten appear the
most nutritious, and together with mucilage
at the same time, the most abundant ingredients
contained in those vegetables from
which man derives his subsistence. Hence,
from time immemorial, and in all parts of
the earth, man has used farinaceous seeds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>as part of his food, for they contain the
above-mentioned materials in the greatest
abundance. Of these the most nutritive
are the seeds of the <i>Cerealia</i>, under which
title are commonly comprehended the <i>Gramineæ</i>,
or <i>Culminiferous</i> plants. Whilst
the seeds of the <i>Gramineæ</i> supply the
most important part of food furnished by
the vegetable kingdom, in almost every
part of the world, their leaves and young
shoots support that class of animals hence
called graminivorous, whose flesh is most
generally eaten.</p>

<p class='c009'>These vegetables are distributed so universally
over the face of the earth, and have
become to such a degree the object of culture,
that they are very generally made into
bread, or are employed instead of it; and,
upon the whole, it appears that they are
nutritive merely in the proportion to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>quantity of farinaceous matter contained in
them; but this substance exists in different
combinations in different cereal and leguminous
seeds. It is combined with gluten
in wheat, with a saccharine matter in oats,
and in many leguminous seeds, such as
Harricot beans and pease, and with viscous
mucilage in rye and Windsor beans.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next to the <i>Cerealia</i> and <i>Leguminosæ</i>
may be ranged the oily farinaceous seeds,
such as almonds, walnuts, filberts, &amp;c.
These abound in starch and mucilage.
The use of chocolate, which is prepared
from the chocolate nut, growing in the
West Indies, ground into a paste, with or
without sugar, is in itself a nutritious substance,
and to those with whom it agrees,
it may be considered as a wholesome nutritious
aliment. Yet the vegetable farina,
in this state of existence, though highly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>nutritious, and to many palates very
agreeable, is more difficult of digestion,
and does not, upon the whole, afford a
very wholesome alimentary substance.
When too freely used, those kinds of seeds
are sure to disagree, more especially if
from age the oil has become rancid. They
must be considered rather as a delicacy
than as fitted to form a portion of our daily
food, and with some particular stomachs
they never agree.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the alimentary farinaceous roots, the
potatoe, boiled or roasted, is one of the
most useful, and perhaps after the <i>Cerealia</i>,
one of the most wholesome and most nutritious
vegetables in common use; its
nourishing powers, there can be no doubt,
depend upon the amylaceous fecula of
which it is chiefly composed. The Jerusalem
artichoke deserves likewise to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>noticed here, as being a highly alimentary
root, chiefly composed of farinaceous
matter. Of the fruits rich in farinaceous
and mucilaginous matter, few are indigenous.
The chesnut, when roasted, affords
an alimentary food, but in the East and
West Indies the bread fruit, bananas, and
the fruit of the plantain tree, are the substitutes
for bread.</p>

<p class='c009'>Scarcely any of the various alimentary
substances employed by man are consumed
in the raw and crude state in which they
are presented to us by nature. Almost all
of them are previously subjected to some
kind of preparation, or change, by which
for the most part they are rendered more
wholesome and more digestible, and sometimes
more nutritive. Accordingly, the
observations we have made on the properties
of different vegetable aliments, are to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>be considered as applied to them in the
state in which they are commonly used
among us.</p>

<p class='c009'>When in the preparation of bread a
baking heat is applied to the flour dough,
a complete change is produced in the constitution
of the mass. The new substance
of bread differs materially from flour, it no
longer forms a tenacious mass with water,
nor can starch and gluten be any more separated
from it.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the application of heat to vegetables
the more volatile and watery parts are in
some cases dissipated. The different principles,
according to their peculiar properties,
are extracted, softened, dissolved, or
coagulated; but most commonly they are
changed into new combinations, so as to
be no longer distinguishable by the forms
and chemical properties which they originally
possessed.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>In like manner the leguminous seeds,
and farinaceous roots are greatly altered
by the chemical action of heat. The raw
potatoe is ill-flavoured, extremely indigestible,
and even unwholesome. By roasting,
or boiling, it becomes farinaceous,
sweet, and agreeable to the taste, wholesome,
digestible, and highly nutritious.
Little is lost, and nothing is added to the
potatoe by this process, yet its properties
are greatly changed; its principles, in
short, have suffered very remarkable chemical
changes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even in the simple boiling of the various
leguminous seeds, pot-herbs, and esculent
roots, the effect does not seem confined to
the mere softening of the fibres, the solution
of some, and coagulation of other of
their juices and principles; not only their
texture, but their flavour, and other sensible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>qualities have undergone a change,
by which their alimentary properties have
been improved; the farinaceous matter by
boiling is rendered soluble, the vegetable
fibre softened. Saccharine matter is often
formed, mucilage and jelly extracted and
combined, and the product is rendered
more palatable, wholesome, and nourishing.
And, although every country has its
own favourite articles of food, and modes
of preparing them, and there is perhaps no
subject in regard to which local prejudices
are so strong, yet there can be no reason
why the farinaceous matter of cereal seeds
should always be consumed in the state of
bread; many of them are not less agreeable,
and not less wholesome in other
forms of food.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Scotland nine-tenths of those in the
more humble walks of life live upon barleybroth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>and there are not more healthy people
to be found any where.—<i>Cullen’s Materia
Medica</i>, v. I. p. 287.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is chiefly to save the trouble of dressing
any other kind of food, and that bread,
from its portability and convenience of always
being ready, has become the principal
sustenance, but it is far from being the most
economical method of using farinaceous
grain. There can be no doubt that the
same quantity of farinaceous matter made
into bread might, in other forms, be used to
a much greater advantage; for the great
art of preparing good and wholesome food
is to convert the alimentary matter into such
a substance as to fill up the stomach and
alimentary canal without overcharging it
with more nutritive matter than is requisite
for the support of the animal, and this may
be done either by bread, or by converting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>the mealy substance of which it is composed
into other forms, of which there is a great
variety.</p>

<p class='c009'>Persons who have travelled much on the
continent are well aware that our neighbours
have the art of throwing much more
variety and gratification of the palate into
the article of subsistence which has been
emphatically called the staff of life, than we
possess. The French and Germans convert
the farinaceous flour of vegetables into
a variety of excellent articles of food, and
not serving, like our own, as a mere companion
to pair off with so many mouthfuls
of meat.</p>

<p class='c009'>In speaking thus of the use of bread, I
do not mean to deny that bread is highly
alimentary, its nourishing powers are undoubtedly
very great.</p>

<p class='c009'>The finest bread, says an eminent physician
(Dr. Buchan), is not always the best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>adapted for answering the purposes of nutrition.
Household bread, which is made
by grinding the whole grain, and only separating
the coarse bran, is, without doubt, the
most wholesome.</p>

<p class='c009'>The people of South Britain generally
prefer bread made of the finest wheat flour,
while those of the Northern countries eat a
mixture of flour and oatmeal, or rye bread.
The common people of Scotland also eat a
mixed bread, but more frequently bread
made of oatmeal only.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Germany the common bread is made
of rye. The flour of millet is made in
France, Spain, and Italy, into wholesome
and nourishing pastry and puddings.
The American and West Indian labourer
thinks no bread so strengthening as that
which is made of Indian corn.</p>

<p class='c009'>The inhabitants of Westphalia, who are
a hardy and robust people, capable of enduring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>the greatest fatigues, live on a coarse
brown rye bread, which still retains the
opprobrious name once given to it by a
French traveller, “<i>Bon pour Nicole</i>—good
for his horse Nichol.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The great advantage of eating pure and
genuine bread must be obvious; but bread
is often spoiled to please the eye. I have
elsewhere<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a> shewn, that in the making of
bread, more especially in London, various
ingredients are occasionally mingled with
the dough. The baker is obliged to suit the
caprice of his customers, to have his bread
light and porous, and of a pure white colour.
It is impossible to produce this sort of bread
from flour alone, unless it be of the finest
quality. The best flour, however, being
mostly used by the biscuit bakers and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>pastry cooks, it is only from the inferior
sorts that bread is made; and it becomes
necessary, in order to have it of that light
and porous quality, and of a fine white, to
mix alum with the dough. Without this
ingredient the flour used by the London
bakers would not yield so white a bread
as that sold in this metropolis, and herein
consists the fraud, that the baker is enabled
by the use of this ingredient to produce,
from bad materials, bread that is light,
white, and porous, but of which the quality
does not correspond to the appearance, and
thus to impose upon the public.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>HISTORICAL SKETCH<br /> <br />OF<br /> <br /><span class='xxlarge'>THE ART OF MAKING BREAD.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>Nothing appears so easy at first sight,
as to grind corn, or other farinaceous substances,
to knead the flour with water into
dough, and to convert it, by baking, into
porous bread. But, simple as these operations
may now appear to us, the art of
making loaf-bread was by no means one of
the earliest among human inventions.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>For, however essential this species of
food may be considered among us as an
article of primary subsistence, it is perfectly
certain, that men had long existed
in a state of civilization, before bread was
known among them.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is evident that every species of corn
must have been originally the spontaneous
production of the earth; but as the grain,
previous to cultivation, would grow but
scantily, its importance as food might long
escape observation, and mankind would
naturally derive a more obvious, though
less nutritive subsistence, from acorns,
berries, and other fruits which were within
their reach. Ages elapsed ere Ceres, according
to the Grecian mythology, descended
from heaven to teach mankind the
use of agriculture.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the early ages of society, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>to some historians, men were satisfied with
parching their corn for immediate use as
food. The next advance appears to have
been, to pulverize the grain in a mortar
or handmill, and to form it, by the addition
of water or milk, into a kind of porridge;
or to make the bruised grain into
dough, which was rendered eatable by
baking on embers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even after the method of grinding corn
into meal, and separating the bran by sifting,
had become known, it was long before
the art of fermenting the dough, in order
to produce bread full of eyes and of a soft
consistence, was discovered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Like most other operations of primary
importance, the origin of the art of making
bread is lost in the darkness of ages past.</p>

<p class='c009'>We are, however, certain that the Jews
practised this art in the time of Moses; for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>we find in the Book of Exodus, chap. xii.
v. 18, a prohibition to make use of <i>leavened</i>,
that is, fermented bread, during the
celebration of the Passover. But it does
not appear that <i>loaf-bread</i> was known to
Abraham, for in his history we read frequently
of cakes, but not of fermented
bread. It is, therefore, very probable, that
the art of making fermented bread took its
rise in the East, and that the Jews learned
it from the Egyptians.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Greeks attribute the art of making
bread to the god Pan.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bakers were unknown in Rome till the
year of the city 850, or about 200 years
before the Christian era. The Roman
bakers, according to Pliny, came from
Greece with the Macedonian army. Before
this period, the Romans were often
distinguished by the appellation of <i>eaters
of pap</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>At the time of Augustus, there were upwards
of 300 baking houses in Rome, almost
the whole of which were occupied by
Greeks. The bakers enjoyed in ancient
Rome great privileges. The public granaries
were entrusted to their care; they
formed a corporation, or kind of college,
from which neither they nor their children
were permitted to withdraw. They were
exempted from guardianships and public
services, which might interfere with their
occupation. They were eligible to become
Senators; and those who married the
daughters of bakers, became members of
the college.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the establishment of bakers in
Rome, the art of making loaf, or fermented
bread, spread amongst the ancient Gauls;
but its progress in the northern countries
of Europe was slow, and in some northern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>districts, the luxury of eating fermented, or
loaf-bread, is at this day not in general
use. Some of the modern Italians consume
the greatest part of their bread-flour in the
state of <i>macaroni</i> and <i>vermicelli</i>, and in
other forms of <i>polenta</i>, or soft pudding;
and even at present millions of people
neither sow nor reap, but content themselves
with enjoying the spontaneous productions
of the earth.</p>
<h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Bread Corn</span>,</h3>

<p class='c019'>Properly so called, of which loaf-bread
is chiefly made among cultivated nations,
comprehends the seeds of the whole tribe
of (<i>cerealia</i>), or gramineous plants; for
they all contain a farinaceous substance,
of a similar nature, and chiefly composed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>of starch. Those of the <i>cerealia</i> in common
use are the following:</p>

  </tr>

<p class='c009'>With us, wheat is chiefly employed for
the fabrication of bread. It is, in fact, the
only grain of which light porous bread can
be made; but rye and barley are also used
as bread-corn. The farina of the other <i>cerealia</i>
afford also a nutritive and wholesome
bread; though their flour is not so susceptible
of the panary fermentation, it
cannot be made into the white texture of
the wheaten loaf. The bread formed
from them is consequently much inferior to
that prepared from wheat. The following
seeds are chiefly employed to make a species
of bread:</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c009'>Oats are used in the north of Europe for
making a kind of bread, called oatmeal-cake,
and particularly by the inhabitants
of Scotland. Maize is frequently employed
as bread-corn in North America.</p>

<p class='c009'>Rice nourishes more human beings than
all the other seeds together, used as food;
and it is by many considered the most nutritive
of all sorts of grain. A very ridiculous
prejudice has existed with respect
to rice, namely, that it is prejudicial to the
sight, by causing diseases of the eye; but
no authority can warrant this assertion:
on the contrary, the opinion of the ablest
men (Cullen’s Mat. Med. v. i. p. 229) may
be quoted in favour of rice being a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>healthy food: and the experience of all
Asia and America may be adduced with
sufficient weight to have answered this objection,
if it had been supported by any
thing more than vulgar prejudice, unsupported
by facts. This grain is peculiarly
calculated to diminish the evils of a scanty
harvest, an inconvenience which must occasionally
affect all countries, particularly
those which are very populous. It is the
most fitted of all food to be of use in relieving
general distress in a bad season<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a>,
because it comes from a part of the world
where provisions are cheap and abundant;
it is light, easy of carriage, keeps well for
a long time, and contains a great deal of
wholesome food within a small compass.
Indeed, it has been ascertained that one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>part of rice contains as much food and
useful nourishment as six of wheat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next to the <i>cerealia</i>, the seeds of <i>leguminous
plants</i> may be regarded as substitutes
for bread corn. Their ripe seeds
afford the greatest quantity of alimentary
matter. Their meal has a sweetish taste,
but they cannot be made into light and
porous bread, without the addition of a
portion of wheaten flour. Their meal, however,
though it forms but a coarse and
indifferent bread, neither very palatable
nor very digestible, except by the most
robust stomachs, is yet highly nutritive.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is remarked by Dr. Cullen, that “on
certain farms of this country, upon which
the leguminous seeds are produced in great
abundance, the labouring servants are
much fed upon that kind of grain; but if
such servants are removed to a farm upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>which the <i>leguminous seeds</i> are not in such
plenty, and therefore they are fed with the
<i>cerealia</i>, they soon find a decay of strength;
and it is common for servants, in making
such removals, to insist on their being provided
daily, or weekly, with a certain quantity
of the leguminous meal.” We are
not, however, to conclude from this observation,
that pease-meal bread, is really
more nutritive than wheaten bread, or than
the meal of the other <i>cerealia</i>. We are
rather disposed to regard it as an example
of the effect of habit.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <i>leguminous seeds</i> employed in the
fabrication of bread, are</p>

<p class='c009'>The whole of this tribe afford a much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>more agreeable, though not a more nutritive
aliment, when their seeds are used
green, young, and tender, and simply
boiled, than when fully ripened, and their
flour baked.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is remarked, that all the substances
of which bread is made, as well as the substitutes
for it, when chemically considered,
are chiefly composed of one and the same
identical material; namely, the farinaceous
matter of the seeds, roots, fruits, or other
products of vegetables, of different climates
and soils; and that <i>starch</i>, or the amylaceous
fecula, forms the most valuable part
of all the materials used for making bread,
and its substitutes.</p>

<p class='c009'>This substance forms by far the most
abundant, the most nourishing, and the
most easy to be procured aliment, obtainable
from the vegetable kingdom.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“Whilst immense tribes of creatures
devour the amylaceous fecula in the grain,
as nature produces it, man knows how to
give it different forms, from the most simple
boiling to the most complicated delicacies
of the arts of the confectioner and
pastry-cook.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is singular that man should waste
so valuable a substance for the purpose of
hair-powder, a kind of custom perhaps ridiculous,
in which modern nations imitate,
without being aware of it, those people
whom they term barbarous, and by which
custom they lavish away a portion of the
subsistence of a great number of families.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This nutritive aliment, we find, exists in
various combinations, in the roots, seeds,
in the stems, and fruits of plants. Many
roots abounding in the amylaceous fecula,
yields a palatable and highly nutritious
aliment.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Hence the potatoe is a substance largely
employed as a substitute for bread. Its
nutritious qualities are fully ascertained
by the experience of all Europe; it makes
a considerable portion of the food of the
poor; and in Ireland in particular, millions
of people exist, who, from sufficient evidence,
we are pretty certain live for years
together almost wholly on this root and
water, without any other seasoning than a
little salt. It contains much amylaceous
fecula, and when mixed with wheaten flour,
may be formed into good and palatable
bread. Other substances, besides the
grains before mentioned, are in different
parts of the world substituted for bread.
These are the following:</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>
  <h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">The Bread-Fruit.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>The Bread-fruit Tree (<i>Artocarpus incisa</i>)
affords the inhabitants of the South Pacific
Ocean a substance resembling bread. They
only climb the tree to gather the fruit,
which is of a round shape, from five to six
inches in diameter; it grows on boughs
like apples, and, when quite ripe, is of a
yellowish colour. The bread-fruit has a
tough reticulated rind; there is neither
seed nor stone in the inside of it. The
eatable part, which lies between the skin
and the core, is as white as snow, and of
the consistence of new bread. The fruit
is roasted on embers, or baked in an oven,
which scorches the rind and turns it black;
this is rasped off, and there remains a thin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>white crust, while the inside is soft and
white, like crumbs of fine loaf-bread. It
is eaten new, for if it is kept longer than
twenty-four hours, it becomes harsh and
unpalatable. It is also boiled, by which
means the interior is rendered white, like
a boiled potatoe. They make three dishes
of it, by putting either water or the milk
of the cocoa-nut to it, then beating it into
a paste with a stone pestle, and afterwards
mixing it with banana paste, which has
been suffered to become sour.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bread-fruit remains in season eight
months in the year, during which time the
natives eat no other sort of food of the
bread kind; and the deficiency of the other
four months of the year, is made up chiefly
with cocoa-nuts, bananas, plantains, bread
nuts (<i>brosimum alicastrum</i>), and other farinaceous
fruits.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>
  <h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Sago Bread.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>The Sago-Tree (<i>Cycas Circinalis</i>), which
grows spontaneously in the East Indies,
and particularly on the Coast of Malabar,
furnishes to numerous Indian tribes their
bread. In the Islands of Banda and Amboyna,
they saw the body of the tree into
small pieces, and, after bruising and beating
them in a mortar, pour water upon the
fragments; this is left for some hours undisturbed,
to suffer the pithy farinaceous
matter to subside. The water is then
poured off, and the meal, being properly
dried, is formed into cakes, or fermented
and made into bread, which, it is said, eats
nearly as well as wheaten bread.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Hottentots make a kind of bread of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>another species of sago-tree (<i>Cycas Resoluta</i>).
The pith, or medulla, which abounds
in the trunk of this little palm, is collected
and tied up in dressed calf’s or sheep’s
skin, and then buried in the ground for
several weeks, which renders it mellow
and tender. It is then kneaded with water
into dough, and made into small loaves or
cakes, which are baked under embers.
Other Hottentots, not quite so nice, merely
dry and roast the farinaceous pith, and
afterwards make it into a kind of frumety
or porridge.</p>
<h3 class='c018'>SAGO.</h3>

<p class='c019'>The same meal, or medulla, of the sago-tree,
reduced into grain, by passing it
whilst still moist through a kind of sieve,
produces the <i>sago</i> of commerce, which receives
its brown colour by being heated on
hot stones.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>
  <h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Casava Bread.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>In the Caribbee Islands they make bread
of a very poisonous root (<i>Jatropa Maniat</i>),
rendered wholesome by the extraction of
its acrid juice, which the Indians use for
poisoning their arrows. A tea-spoonful
of the juice is sufficient to poison a man.</p>

<p class='c009'>The root of the maniat, after being
crashed, scraped clean, and grated in a
tub, is enclosed in a sack of rushes, of very
loose texture, which is suspended upon a
stick placed upon two wooden forks. To
the bottom of this sack a heavy vessel is
suspended, which, by drawing the sack,
presses the grated root and receives the
juice that flows out of it. When the starch
is well exhausted of its juice, it is exposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>to smoke in order to dry it; and when well
dried it is passed through a sieve. In this
state it is termed Casava. It is baked
into cakes, by spreading it on hot plates of
iron or earth, turning it on both sides, in
order to give it a good reddish colour.</p>
<h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">TAPIOCA.</span></h3>

<p class='c019'>The article of commerce, called <i>tapioca</i>,
is the finest part of the farinaceous pith of
the casava. It is separately collected and
formed into small tears, by straining the
mass while still moist, to form it into small
irregular lumps.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>
  <h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Plantain Bread.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>The Plantain Tree (<i>Musa Paradisiaca</i>),
which is a native of the East Indies and
other parts of the Asiatic Continent, furnishes
the inhabitants with a species of
bread. The fruit of the plantain-tree is
about a foot long, and from an inch and a
half to two inches in diameter. It is at
first green, but when ripe of a pale yellow.
It has a tough skin, and within is a soft
pulp of a sweet flavour. The fruit is generally
cut before it is ripe; the green skin
is peeled off, and the heart is roasted in a
clear coal fire for a few minutes, and frequently
turned; it is then scraped and
served up as bread. This tree is cultivated
on an extensive scale in Jamaica. Without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>this fruit, Dr. Wright says, the Islands
would be scarcely inhabitable, as no species
of provisions could supply its place. Even
flour and bread itself would be less agreeable
to the labouring Negro.</p>
<h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Banana Bread.</span></h3>

<p class='c019'>The fruit of the Banana Tree (<i>Musa
Sapientum</i>), differs from the preceding,
being shorter, straighter, and rounder. It
is about four or five inches long, of the
shape of a cucumber, and of a highly grateful
flavour. Bananas grow in bunches
that weigh twelve pounds and upwards.
This fruit yields a softer pulp than the
plantain-tree, and of a more luscious taste.
It is never eaten green, but when ripe is a
very pleasant food, either raw or fried in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>slices like fritters. It is relished by all
ranks of people in the West Indies. When
the natives of the West Indies undertake
a voyage, they take the ripe fruit of the
banana and make provisions of the paste;
and, having squeezed it through a sieve,
form the mass into loaves, which are dried
in the sun or baked on hot ashes, after
being previously wrapped up in leaves.</p>
<h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Bread of Dried Fish.</span></h3>

<p class='c019'>The Laplanders, who have no corn of
their own, make a kind of bread of the
inner soft bark of a pine tree, either mixed
with the coarsest barley meal, or with dried
fish beaten into powder. The bark is collected
when the sap is rising, it is afterwards
dried in the sun, or over a slow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>fire, and then mixed with the coarsest barley
meal, or dried fish beaten into powder.
The poorer people grind the chaff, and
even some of the straw along with the
barley.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another kind of bread is made of dried
fish and the root of the water dragon
(<i>Calla palustris</i>), the root is taken up in the
spring, before the leaves shoot out. It is
dried, pounded, and boiled, till it becomes
thick, like flummery, and after standing
three or four days to lose its bitterness it
is mixed with the powder of dried fish
and the inner bark of the pine tree, and then
made into a stiff paste, and baked over
embers.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>
  <h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Bread made of Moss.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Some species of the tribe of Lichen, contain
a considerable portion of starch, as the
<i>Lichen Rangiferinus</i>, or rein-deer moss,
which affords food to the stags and other
fallow cattle of the North of Europe. The
Icelanders form the lichen islandicus into
bread, which is found to be extremely nutritious.
The moss is collected in the summer,
and, when dry, ground into powder,
of which bread and gruel, or pottage, are
made. It is sometimes also put whole into
broth, or is boiled in whey, till it be converted
into a jelly. In general, it is either
previously steeped for some hours in warm
water, or the water of the first boiling is
rejected, in order to remove a part of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>bitter extractive matter, which, if left, produces
a disagreeable taste, and is apt to
prove purgative.</p>
<h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Bread made of Earth.</span></h3>

<p class='c019'>The strangest substitute for bread that
has ever been employed, is a sort of white
earth. The poor in the Lordship of Moscoa
in Upper Lusania, have been frequently
compelled to make use of this earth as a
substitute for bread.</p>

<p class='c009'>The earth is dug out of a pit where saltpetre
had formerly been worked; when
exposed to the rays of the sun it splits and
cracks, and small globules issue from it
like meal, which ferments when mixed with
flour. On this earth, baked into bread,
many persons have subsisted a considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>time. A similar earth is met with near
Genomu, in Catalonia.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the western parts of Luisania too, the
inhabitants have a most extraordinary custom
of eating a white earth, mixed with
clay and salt.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rowers also, who ply on the river
Mississippi, frequently drink large quantities
of muddy water, which cannot fail to
leave in the stomach a considerable quantity
of earth. But it cannot be doubted,
that a large quantity of earthy substances
taken into the stomach would prove deleterious
to health.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'><span class="blackletter">Analysis of Bread Flour.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>On examining bread corn, for instance
wheat, we perceive an outside coating,
which after the grain has been soaked in
water, may readily be peeled off. This
forms the bran of the flour. Immediately
under it, is that part of the grain which
affords the coarsest flour, it is soft to the
touch, and not easily reduced to an impalpable
powder, and of a sweetish taste.
This constitutes about one half of the grain.
Underneath this substance lies what is
called by millers, the kernel or heart of the
wheat, namely, a hard mealy substance,
almost transparent. This part of the grain
is capable of being speedily reduced to an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>impalpable powder, it ferments more
readily than the outer layers, and it is
this which produces the finest and best
kind of wheaten flour. Such is the mechanical
constitution of the grain. When
chemically examined we find that the flour
of wheat, rye, and barley, is composed of
three ingredients, or immediate constituent
parts, which may be separated by simple
processes, viz. starch, gluten, and saccharine
mucilage. The proportion of these
differ materially in different kinds of corn.
The method of separating them is as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>Make any quantity of wheaten flour into
a stiff paste with cold water, and let it be
kneaded and wrought in the hands under
water; or put the flour into a coarse linen
bag, and knead it between the hands whilst
a small rill of cold water is suffered to pass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>over it. The water will carry away the
starch in the form of a white powder, and
the dough become more and more elastic,
in proportion as the water carries off the
starch; continue kneading the mass till the
water runs off from the kneaded dough
colourless. It will also be observed, that in
proportion as the water carries off the
starch, the paste in the bag assumes a more
grey colour, less brilliant, as it were
semi-transparent, and of a softer consistence,
but, at the same time, more tenaceous,
more viscid, more gluey, and more
elastic.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus the flour is separated into three
substances, by a method incapable of decomposing
or altering any of its immediate
constituent parts. The starch is precipitated
in a white powder at the bottom of
the water, from which it may readily be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>separated by suffering it to subside, and
the supernatant liquid, contains in solution
the saccharine mucilage; this may
be obtained in the form of a syrup, by
evaporating slowly in a warm place the
clear decanted fluid; and the third substance,
the gluten, remains in the bag, in
the state of a soft, cohesive, and elastic
substance.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a similar manner the analysis of any
species of bread corn may be effected.</p>

<p class='c026'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>REASON WHY OATS, PEASE, BEANS, RICE, MAIZE,
MILLET, BUCKWHEAT, AND OTHER NUTRITIVE
GRAINS CANNOT BE MADE INTO LIGHT
AND POROUS BREAD.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every person is acquainted with the
difference there is between light well fermented
bread, and that which is sodden,
heavy, and badly risen, and the decided
preference given to the former over the
latter, as the most palatable, and easy of
digestion.</p>

<p class='c009'>The only substances for making <i>loaf
bread</i>, by which term is meant, bread which
is light, white, and porous, is the flour of
wheat; and it is to the larger quantity of
gluten, that wheat flour owes the property
of being converted into loaf-bread. The
average quantity of gluten contained in
wheat flour, amounts to about one-fifth of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>the whole weight of the meal; but it varies
in quantity in different kinds of wheat, according
to the soil and season in which the
corn has been reared, culture, and various
other circumstances. Wheat kept in damp
storehouses affords scarcely any gluten,
and hence, in proportion as the flour of
wheat is altered and deteriorated, which
happens, as it is known, when it is kept too
much compressed, without being occasionally
stirred up and aired in hot and close
granaries; in a word, as it undergoes a
chemical change, its property of making
good bread is diminished; and chemical
analysis shows the quantity of gluten has
become lessened under such circumstances;
and when it is greatly diminished
the meal forms no longer a tenaceous
ductile dough. The spoiled flour produces
a kind of bread which is heavy, harsh, and
difficult of digestion.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>The greater the proportion of gluten,
the easier the panification of bread-flour is
effected, and the better is the bread. The
wheat of the South of Europe generally
contains a larger quantity of gluten, and is
therefore more excellent for the manufacture
of Maccaroni, Vermicelli, and other
alimentary substances, requiring a glutenous
paste.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sir H. Davy found the flour of the wheat
of this country to consist of from twenty
to twenty-four per cent. of gluten. Barley
contains six, and rye five per cent. of gluten.</p>

<p class='c009'>We may now understand why potatoes,
rice, beans, pease, buckwheat, millet, oats,
and other nutritive cereal grains, abounding
in starch, cannot be made into light
and porous bread, although they are well
calculated for being made into wholesome
puddings, and why they only form crude,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>heavy, insipid cakes, when made into dough
and baked, and not light porous loaf-bread.</p>

<p class='c009'>In further confirmation of this statement
it may be remarked, that if gluten of
wheat, or only a portion of wheaten flour
be incorporated by kneading with the before-named
kinds of flour, a fermentable
cohesive paste is produced, from which
perfect bread may be made.</p>
<h3 class='c018'>THEORY OF THE PANIFICATION OF BREAD FLOUR.</h3>

<p class='c019'>Bread, when chemically examined, is
very different from flour; it no longer forms
with water a tenaceous ductile mass, nor
can starch, gluten, and saccharine mucilage
be separated from it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The chemical changes that take place in
the panification of bread-flour, are by no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>means well understood. The saccharine
mucilage, it appears, commences the fermentative
chemical action that takes place
in the dough, for without this substance, a
mixture of flour, yeast, and water, cannot
be made into true bread. The fermenting
process when once commenced, is kept up
by the gluten, forming the body of the
paste through which the fecula and saccharine
matter are diffused; and when the
slight fermentation which it suffers, from
changes in the saccharine matter, and supported
by the presence of the gluten,
has commenced, the paste becomes spongy
and porous, from the disengagement of
carbonic acid gas, while it still retains in
some measure its elasticity; hence the
lightness and porosity of well-baked
wheaten bread; and hence bread, possessing
these qualities, cannot be prepared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>from the flour of oats, barley, rye, or rice,
or from any of the nutritive roots, as in all
of these the quantity of gluten is considerably
less, or entirely wanting, and no gluey
elastic dough can be formed. The starch,
which was merely diffused through the
gluey dough, combines, during the baking,
with a portion of water, into a stiff jelly,
which renders the bread more digestible,
and the gluten wholly disappears. A portion
of carbonic acid gas, which becomes
disengaged during the fermenting process,
enlarges the bulk of the dough, which is
thus rendered light, porous, and full of
eyes, or cavities, in consequence of the extraction
of the air bubbles, in the viscid
glutenous matter; and the porosity of the
bread is in proportion to the extent to
which the rising of the dough is suffered to
proceed.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Some chemists persuade themselves
that the fermentation of the flour dough
differs materially from the fermentation of
saccharine substances; namely, that the
vinous, acetous, and putrefactive stages of
the fermenting process take place simultaneously
in the dough. They imagine the
vinous fermentation to take place in the
saccharine mucilage, the acetous in the
starch, and the putrefactive in the gluten
at the same time, and from the modification
of each by the others, they consider that
peculiar action to originate which converts
paste into bread. Against this opinion,
however, the following objections may be
urged. In the first place, the quantity of
saccharine mucilage is so extremely small
as to produce no sensible effect alone on the
whole mass, and what little there is probably
passes speedily into the acetous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>fermentation. Secondly, the temperature
that is required for bread-making is considerably
lower than that at which starch
dissolves in water, and where this is the
case no alteration will take place, even in
a long course of time: this is clearly shown
by the usual process of starch-making, in
which the bruised wheat is fermented for
several days in large vats, in order to destroy
the gluten, after which the starch is
procured by simple deposition from the
washings of the residue; and thirdly, no
vestige whatever of the products evolved
during the putrefactive fermentation of
gluten, can be traced in any stage of the
panification of bread flour.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'><span class="blackletter">Unleavened Bread.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>Bread prepared by baking from the
meal of farinaceous seeds kneaded with
water into a dough and baked, is divided
into three sorts, namely;—1. Unleavened
bread; 2. Leavened bread; and, 3. Bread
made with yeast.</p>

<p class='c009'>Unleavened bread contains all the component
parts of the flour but little altered.
The meal is simply mixed with water, and
baked into cakes. It is heavy, dry, friable,
and not porous. The oatmeal bread of
Scotland, is unleavened bread; as also sea
biscuit, and all other kinds of biscuit.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bread that is eaten by the Jews
during the passover is unleavened. The
usage of which was introduced in commemoration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>of their hasty departure from
Egypt, [Exodus, chap. 12, v. 14 to 17.]
when they had not leisure to bake leavened
bread, but took the dough before it was
fermented and baked unleavened cakes.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Roman catholic countries it is still
used, and prepared with the finest wheaten
flour, moistened with water, and pressed
between two plates, graven like wafer
moulds, being first rubbed with wax to prevent
the paste from sticking, and when dry
it is used. Unleavened bread is hardly less
nutritious than loaf or fermented bread,
but it is generally speaking neither so
wholesome nor so digestible.</p>

<p class='c019'>To a peck of oatmeal add a few table-spoonsful
of salt; knead the mixture into a
stiff paste, with warm water, roll it out into
thin cakes, and bake it in an oven or on
embers.</p>

<p class='c009'>In some cottages oatmeal bread undergoes
a partial fermentation, whereby it is rendered
lighter; but the generality of the
people in the more humble walks of life,
where oatmeal bread is eaten, merely soften
their oatmeal with water, and having added
to it a little salt, bake it into cakes. To
strangers oatmeal bread has a dry, harsh,
unpleasant taste, but the cottagers of
Scotland, in particular, most commonly
prefer it to wheaten bread.</p>

quantity of oatmeal, previously mixed by
passing the flour through a sieve, add three
or four ounces of salt, knead it into a
stiff mass with warm water, roll it out into
thin cakes, and bake them in an oven. In
some parts of Lancashire and Scotland,
this kind of bread is made into flattened
rolls, and the cottagers usually bake them
in an iron pot.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Norway they make unleavened bread
of oatmeal and barley, which keeps thirty
or forty years, and is considered the better
for being old, so that at the baptism of a
child, bread is sometimes used which has
been baked perhaps at the baptism of its
great grandfather.</p>

<p class='c019'>The bread made of maize flour, which is
in common use in North America, is
unleavened bread. The maize flour is
kneaded with a little salt and water into a
stiff mass; which, after being rolled out
into thin cakes, is usually baked on a hot

<p class='c009'>Another kind of unleavened <i>maize cakes</i>,

<p class='c019'>Take acorns, fully ripe, deprive them of
their covers and beat them into a paste, let
them lay in water for a night, and then press
the water from them, which deprives the
acorns entirely of their astringency. Then
dry and powder the mass for use. When
wanted, knead it up into a dough with
water, and roll it out into thin cakes, which
may be baked over embers.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Bread made after this method is by no
means disagreeable, and even to this day,
it is said to be made use of in some
countries.</p>
<h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Sea Biscuit.</span></h3>

<p class='c019'>The process of biscuit-baking for the
British navy is as follows, and it is equally
simple and ingenious. The meal, and
every other article, being supplied with
much certainty and simplicity, large lumps
of dough, consisting merely of flour and
water, are mixed up together; and as the
quantity is so immense as to preclude, by
any common process, a possibility of kneading
it, a man manages, or, as it is termed,
rides a machine, which is called a horse.
This machine is a long roller, apparently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>about four or five inches in diameter, and
about seven or eight feet in length. It has
a play to a certain extension, by means of
a staple in the wall, to which is inserted a
kind of eye, making its action like the
machine by which they cut chaff for horses.
The lump of dough being placed exactly
in the centre of a raised platform, the man
sits upon the end of the machine, and
literally rides up and down throughout its
whole circular direction, till the dough is
equally indented; and this is repeated till
it is sufficiently kneaded; at which times,
by the different positions of the lines, large
or small circles are described, according as
they are near to or distant from the wall.</p>

<p class='c009'>The dough in this state is handed over
to a second workman, who slices it with a
prodigious knife; and it is then in a proper
state for the use of those bakers who attend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>the oven. These are five in number; and
their different departments are as well
calculated for expedition and correctness,
as the making of pins, or other mechanical
employments. On each side of a large
table, where the dough is laid, stands a
workman; at a small table near the oven
stands another; a fourth stands by the side
of the oven, to receive the bread; and a
fifth to supply the peel. By this arrangement
the oven is as regularly filled and
the whole exercise performed in as exact
time, as a military evolution. The man on
the further side of the large table, moulds
the dough, having previously formed it
into small pieces till it has the appearance
of muffins, although rather thinner, and
which he does two together, with each
hand; and, as fast as he accomplishes this
task, he delivers his work over to the man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>on the other side of the table, who stamps
them with a docker on both sides with a
mark. As he rids himself of this work, he
throws the biscuits on the smaller table
next the oven, where stands the third
workman, whose business is merely to separate
the different pieces into two, and
place them immediately under the hand
of him who supplies the oven, whose work
of throwing, or rather chucking, the bread
upon the peel, must be so exact, that if he
looked round for a single moment, it is
impossible he should perform it correctly.
The fifth receives the biscuit on the peel,
and arranges it in the oven; in which duty
he is so very expert, that though the
different pieces are thrown at the rate of
seventy in a minute, the peel is always
disengaged in time to receive them separately.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>As the oven stands open during the
whole time of filling it, the biscuits first
thrown in would be first baked, were there
not some counteraction to such an inconvenience.
The remedy lies in the ingenuity
of the man who forms the pieces of dough,
and who, by imperceptible degrees, proportionably
diminishes their size, till the
loss of that time, which is taken up during
the filling of the oven, has no more effect
to the disadvantage of one of the biscuits
than to another.</p>

<p class='c009'>So much critical exactness and neat
activity occur in the exercise of this labour,
that it is difficult to decide whether the
palm of excellence is due to the moulder,
the marker, the splitter, the chucker, or the
depositor; all of them, like the wheels of a
machine, seeming to be actuated by the
same principle. The business is to deposit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>in the oven seventy biscuits in a minute;
and this is accomplished with the regularity
of a clock; the clack of the peel, during its
motion in the oven, operating like the
pendulum.</p>

<p class='c009'>The biscuits thus baked, are dried in lofts
over the oven till they are perfectly dry, to
prevent them getting mouldy when stored
for use.</p>

<p class='c009'>One-hundred and twelve pounds of
flour produce one hundred and two pounds
of perfectly dry biscuits.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'><span class="blackletter">Leavened Bread,</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>Or bread made with a portion of fermented
sour dough, obtained by keeping
some bread dough till the acetous fermentation
takes place, when it swells, rarifies,
and acquires a taste somewhat sour,
and rather disagreeable. This fermented
dough is well worked up with some fresh
dough, which is, by that mixture and moderate
heat, disposed to ferment; and by
this fermentation the dough is attenuated
and divided, carbonic acid is extricated,
which being incapable of disengaging itself
from the tenaceous and solid dough, forms it
into small cavities, and raises and swells it;
hence, the small quantity of fermented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>dough which disposes the rest of the mass
to ferment is called <i>leaven</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Most of the bread used by the people in
the lower walks of life in France, Germany,
Holland, and other European countries, is
made in this manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>Leavened bread, therefore, differs from
unleavened bread, in being fermented by
means of <i>leaven</i>, which is nothing more
than a piece of dough kept in a warm place,
till it undergoes a process of fermentation,
swelling, becoming spongy, and full of air
bubbles, and at length disengaging an
acidulous vapour, and contracting a sour
taste. Leaven must, therefore, be considered
as dough which has fermented and
become sour, but which is still in its
progress towards greater acidity.</p>

<p class='c009'>The addition of leaven, or this species
of ferment to fresh dough, produces an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>important change in the bread, for when a
small portion of leaven is intimately mixed
with a large proportion of fresh dough, it
gradually causes the whole mass to ferment
throughout, a quantity of carbonic acid gas
is extracted from the flour, but remaining
entangled by the tenacity of the mass in
which it is expanded by heat, this raises
the dough, and as soon as the mass has
acquired a due increase of bulk from the
carbonic acid gas which endeavours to
escape, it is judged to be sufficiently fermented
and fit for the oven, the heat of
which, by driving off the water, checks the
fermentation, and forms a bread full of
small cavities, entirely different from the
heavy, compact, viscous masses, made by
baking unfermented dough.</p>

<p class='c009'>A great deal of nicety is required in
conducting this operation, for if it is continued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>too long, the bread will be sour, and
if too short a time has been allowed for
the dough to ferment and rise, it will be
heavy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bread raised by leaven is usually made
of a mixture of wheat and rye, not very
accurately cleared of the bran. It is distinguished
by the name of <i>rye bread</i>; and
the mixture of these two kinds of grain is
called bread-corn, in many parts of the
kingdom, where it is raised on one and the
same piece of ground, and passes through
all the processes of reaping, thrashing,
grinding, &amp;c. A mixture of one-hundred
pounds of equal parts of wheat and rye
flour, produce from one-hundred and fifty-four
to one-hundred and fifty-six pounds
of leavened bread.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>
  <h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Leavened Rye Bread.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Take a piece of dough, of about a pound
weight, and keep it for use—it will keep
several days very well. Mix this dough
with some warm water, and knead it up
with a portion of flour to ferment; then
take half a bushel of flour, and divide it
into four parts; mix a quarter of the flour
with the leaven, and a sufficient quantity of
water to make it into dough, and knead it
well. Let this remain in a corner of your
trough, covered with flannel, until it
ferments and rises properly; then dilute it
with more water, and add another quarter
of the flour, and let it remain and rise.
Do the same with the other two quarters
of the flour, one quarter after another,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>taking particular care never to mix more
flour till the last has risen properly. When
finished, add six ounces of salt; then knead
it again, and divide it into eight loaves,
making them broad, and not so thick and
high as is usually done, by which means
they will be better baked. Let them
remain to rise, in order to overcome the
pressure of the hand in forming them; then
put them in the oven, and reserve a piece
of dough for the next baking. The dough
thus kept, may with proper care, be prevented
from spoiling, by mixing from time
to time small quantities of fresh flour with
it.</p>

<p class='c009'>It requires some attention to be able to
determine the exact quantity of leaven
necessary for the proper fermentation of
the dough. When it is deficient in quantity,
the process of fermentation is interrupted,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>and the bread thus prepared is solid and
heavy, and if too much leaven be used,
it communicates to the bread a disagreeable
sour taste.</p>
<h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Hungarian Rye Bread.</span></h3>

<p class='c019'>Two large handfuls of hops are boiled in
four quarts of water: this is poured upon
as much wheaten bread as it will moisten,
and to this are added four or five pounds of
leaven. When the mass is warm, the
several ingredients are worked together till
well mixed. It is then deposited in a warm
place for twenty-four hours, and afterwards
divided into small pieces, about the size of
a hen’s egg, which are dried by being
placed on a board, and exposed to a dry
air, but not to the sun; when dry, they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>laid up for use, and may be kept half a
year. The ferment, thus prepared, is
applied in the following manner: for baking
six large loaves, six good handfuls of these
balls are dissolved in seven or eight quarts
of warm water; this water is poured through
a sieve into one end of the bread trough,
and after it three quarts of warm water;
the remaining mass being well pressed out.
The liquor is mixed up with flour, sufficient
to form a mass of the size of a large loaf;
this is strewed over with flour: the sieve,
with its contents, is put upon it, and the
whole is covered up warm, and left till it
has risen enough, and its surface has begun
to crack; this forms the leaven. Fifteen
quarts of warm water, in which six handfuls
of salt has been dissolved, are then poured
upon it through the sieve; the necessary
quantity of flour is added, and mixed and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>kneaded with the leaven: this is covered up
warm, and left for about half an hour. It
is then formed into loaves, which are kept
for another half-hour in a warm room; and
after that they are put into the oven, where
they remain two or three hours, according
to their size.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'><span class="blackletter">Bread made with Yeast.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>The principal improvement that has been
made in the art of fabricating bread, consists
in the substitution of yeast, (or the
froth that rises to the surface during the
fermentation of malt liquors,) instead of
common flour dough, in a state of acescency,
called <i>leaven</i>, to rise the bread
dough, made of flour and water, before it
is baked. This substance very materially
improves the bread. Yeast makes the
dough rise more effectually than ordinary
<i>leaven</i>, and the bread thus produced is
much lighter, and free from that sour taste
which may often be perceived in bread
raised with leaven; because too much has
been added to the paste, or because the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>dough has been allowed to advance too far
in the process of fermentation before it was
baked.</p>

<p class='c009'>The discovery of the application of yeast,
to improve the panification of bread flour,
was made and first secretly adopted by the
bakers of Paris; but when the practice was
discovered, the College of Physicians there,
in 1688, declared it prejudicial to health,
and it was not till after a long time that
the bakers succeeded in convincing the
people, that bread made with yeast was superior
to bread made with sour dough or
leaven.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bread used in this metropolis and in
most other large towns in England, is
made of wheaten flour, water, yeast, and
salt. The average proportion are two
pints by weight, of water, to three of flour,
but the proportions vary considerably with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>the diversity of climate, years, season,
age, and grinding of the wheat. There are
some kinds of wheat flour that require precisely
three-fourths of their weight of
water. That flour is always the best
which combines with the greatest possible
quantity of water. Bakers and pastry-cooks
judge of the quality of flour from the
characters of the dough. The best flour
forms instantly by the addition of water
a very gluey elastic paste, whereas bad
flour produces a dough that cannot be
elongated without breaking.</p>

<p class='c009'>The flour, in this case, being seldom mixed
up oftener than twice, that is, the yeast
previously diluted with water, is added
to a part of the flour, and well kneaded;
in a short time, swells and rises in the
baking trough, and is called by the bakers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span><i>setting the sponge</i>. The remainder of the
flour is afterwards added, with a sufficient
quantity of warm water to make it into a
stiff dough, and then allowed to ferment. It
is of essential consequence that the whole
of the yeast should be intimately mixed
with the two-thirds of the quantity of the
flour put into the kneading trough, in order
that the fermentation of the dough may
commence in every part of the mass at the
same time. The dough is then covered up,
and the water which is mixed with the yeast
being warm, speedily extricates air in an
elastic state, and as it is now by kneading,
diffused through every part of the dough,
every particle must become raised, and the
viscidity of the mass retains it, when it is
again well kneaded and made up into
loaves, and put into the oven. The heat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>converts the water also into an elastic
vapour, and the loaf swells more and more,
till at last it is perfectly porous.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the baking, a still greater quantity
of gazeous matter is extricated by the
increased heat; and as the crust of the
bread becomes formed, the air is prevented
from escaping, the water is dissipated, the
loaf rendered somewhat dry and solid, and
between every particle of bread there is a
particle of air, as appears from the spongy
appearance of the bread.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is curious that new flour does not
afford bread of so good a quality as that
which has been kept some months. The
flour of grain too, which has suffered
incipient germination, is much inferior in
the quality of bread prepared from it: and
from this principally appears to arise the
injury which wheat sustains from a wet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>harvest. Various methods have been employed
to remedy the imperfections of bread
from inferior flour, such as washing the
grain with hot water if it is musty, proposed
by Mr. Hatchet;<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c014'><sup>[5]</sup></a> drying and heating it
even to a certain extent; adding various
substances, such as magnesia, &amp;c. Some
experiments on this subject have been given
by Mr. E. Davy. See a Treatise on Adulterations
of Food, Second Edition, p.137.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>METHOD OF MAKING WHEATEN BREAD, AS PRACTISED BY THE LONDON BAKERS.</h3>

<p class='c019'>To make a sack of flour into bread, the
baker pours the flour into the kneading
trough, and sifts it through a fine wire
sieve, which makes it lie very light, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>serves to separate any impurities with
which the flour may be mixed. Two ounces
of alum are then dissolved in about a quart
of boiling water, and the solution (technically
called liquor,) is poured into <i>the
seasoning-tub</i>. Four or five pounds of salt
are likewise put into the tub, and a pailful
of hot water. When this mixture has
cooled to the temperature of about 84°,
from three to four pints of yeast are added;
the whole is mixed, strained through the
seasoning sieve, emptied into a hole made
in the mass of the flour, and mixed up with
the requisite portion of it to the consistence
of a thick batter. Some dry flour is then
sprinkled over the top, and it is covered
up with sacks or cloths. This operation is
called setting <i>quarter sponge</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this situation it is left three or four
hours. It gradually swells and breaks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>through the dry flour scattered on its surface.
An additional quantity, (about one
pailful,) of warm (liquor) water, in which
one ounce of alum is dissolved, is now
added, and the dough is made up into a
paste as before; the whole is then covered
up. In this situation it is left for four or
five hours. This is called <i>setting half
sponge</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The whole is then intimately kneaded
with more water, (about two pails full,) for
upwards of an hour. The dough is cut into
pieces with a knife, and penned to one side
of the trough; some dry flour is sprinkled
over it, and it is left to <i>prove</i> in this state
for about four hours. It is then kneaded
again for half an hour. The dough is now
taken out of the trough, put on the lid,
cut into pieces, and weighed, in order to
furnish the requisite quantity for each loaf.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>The operation of moulding is peculiar,
and can only be learnt by practice; it consists
in cutting the mass of dough destined
for a loaf, into two equal portions: they
are kneaded either round or long, and
one placed in a hollow made in the other,
and the union is completed by a turn of the
knuckles on the centre of the upper piece.</p>

<p class='c009'>The loaves are left in the oven about two
hours and a half, or three hours, when
taken out of the oven, they are turned
with their bottom side upwards to prevent
them from splitting. They are then
covered up with a blanket to cool slowly.</p>

  <h3 class='c018'>QUANTITY OF BREAD OBTAINABLE FROM A GIVEN QUANTITY OF WHEATEN FLOUR.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>A sack of flour, weighing two hundred
and eighty pounds, is made with five
pounds of salt, and from three to four
pints of yeast, into dough, with the requisite
quantity of water, which varies
according to the quality of the flour.</p>

<p class='c009'>The older the flour, provided the wheat
has been sound, and the flour well preserved,
the greater will be the quantity of water
required to convert it into a stiff dough,
and the greater the produce of bread.</p>

<p class='c009'>The quantity of flour for a quartern loaf
is reckoned at an average, three pounds
and a half, which produces, if the flour be
of the best quality, five pounds avoirdupoise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>of dough. The quartern loaf produced
from this quantity of flour weighs four
pounds, five ounces and a half, and hence
the dough loses, during baking, eleven
ounces and a half.</p>

<p class='c009'>The quantity of bread obtainable from
the same quantity of flour is, however,
much influenced by the manner in which
the dough is fermented, and the skilful
regulation of the heat employed for baking
the bread.</p>

<p class='c009'>A variation of temperature also makes a
considerable difference to the baker’s profit
or loss. In summer, a sack of flour will
yield a quartern loaf more than in winter;
and the sifting it, before it is wetted, if it
does not make it produce more bread, certainly
causes the loaves to be larger.</p>

<p class='c009'>The loss of weight occasioned by the
heat is proportional to the extent of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>surface of the loaf, and to the length of
time it remains in the oven. Hence the
smaller the surface, or the nearer the figure
of the loaf approaches to a globe, the
smaller is the loss of weight sustained in
baking; and the longer the loaf continues
in the oven the greater is the loss.</p>

<p class='c009'>A loaf that weighed just four pounds
when taken out of the oven, after the usual
baking, was put in again, and after ten
minutes was found to have lost two ounces,
and in ten minutes more it lost another
ounce. The longer bread is kept the lighter
it is, unless it be kept in a damp place, or
wrapt round with a wet cloth, which is
an excellent method of preserving bread
fresh and free from mould, for a long time.</p>

  <h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Home-made Wheaten Bread.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Take a bushel of wheaten flour, and put
two third parts of it in one heap into a
trough or tub; then dilute two pints of yeast
with three or four pints of warm water, and
add to this mixture from eight to ten ounces
of salt. Make a hole in the middle of the
heap of flour, pour the mixture of yeast,
salt, and water into it, and knead the whole
into an uniform stiff dough, with such an
additional quantity of water as is requisite
for that purpose, and suffer the dough to
rise in a warm place.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the dough has risen, and just
begins again to subside, add to it gradually
the remaining one third part of
the flour; knead it again thoroughly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>taking care to add gradually so much warm
water as is sufficient to form the whole into
a stiff tenaceous dough, and continue the
kneading. At first the mass is very adhesive
and clings to the fingers, but it
becomes less so the longer the kneading is
continued; and when the fist, on being
withdrawn, leaves its perfect impression
in the dough, none of it adhering to the
fingers, the kneading may be discontinued.
The dough may be then divided into loaf
pieces, (of about 5lb. in weight). Knead
each piece once more separately, and having
made it up in the proper form, put it in a
warm place, cover it up with a blanket to
promote the last rising; and when this has
taken place, put it into the oven. When
the loaves are withdrawn they should be
covered up with a blanket to cool as slowly
as possible.</p>

  <h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">To make Pan Bread.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Mix up the flour, salt, and yeast, (See
page <a href='#Page_97'>97</a>), with the requisite portion of
warm water, into a moderately stiff paste;
but instead of causing part of the flour to
ferment, (or setting the sponge), as stated
in the preceding process, suffer the whole
mass to rise at once. Then divide it into
earthenware pans, or sheet iron moulds,
and bake the loaves till nearly done, in a
quick oven; at that time remove them out
of the pans, or moulds, and set them on tins
for a few minutes, in order that the crust
may become brown, and when done wrap
them up in flannel, and rasp them when
cold.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bread made in this manner is much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>more spongy or honeycombed, than bread
made in the common way. It is essential
that the dough be not so stiff, as when
intended for common bread, moulded by
the hand.</p>
<h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Brown Wheaten Bread.</span></h3>

<p class='c019'>Suppose a Winchester bushel of good
wheat weighs fifty-nine pounds, let it be
sent to the mill and ground; including the
bran, the meal will weigh fifty-eight pounds,
for not more than a pound will be lost in

<p class='c009'>Mix it up with water, yeast, and salt, like
the dough of common bread, (See page <a href='#Page_97'>97</a>);
the mass, before it is put into the oven,
will weigh about eighty-eight pounds.</p>

<p class='c009'>Divide it into eighteen loaves, and put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>them into the oven; when thoroughly baked,

<p class='c019'>Take a peck of wheaten flour, the same

boiled potatoes, skinned and mashed; let
the mass be kneaded into a dough, with a
proper quantity of yeast, salt, and warm
milk; make the dough into loaves, and
put them into the oven to bake.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bread, thus prepared, rises well in the
oven, is of a light brown colour, and by no
means of an unpleasant flavour; it tastes so
little of the oatmeal, as to be taken, by those
who are unacquainted with its composition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>for barley or rye bread. It is sufficiently
moist, and, if put in a proper place, keeps
well for a week.</p>
<h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Rolls, French Bread, Muffins and Crumpets.</span></h3>

<p class='c019'>The dough of which rolls are made by
the generality of the London bakers, is
suffered to <i>prove</i>, that is to rise more, than
dough intended to be made into loaf-bread.
It is, therefore, left in the kneading trough,
whilst the loaves made of the same dough
are in the oven. During this period it rises
more, and the fermentation is further
promoted, by placing the rolls, when
moulded, in a warm place, to cause the
dough to expand as much as possible.
When this has taken place, they are put in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>the oven to be baked, which is effected in
about twenty or thirty minutes. When
taken out of the oven they are slightly
brushed over with a buttered brush, which
gives the top crust a shining appearance,
they are then covered up with flannel to cool
gradually.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have witnessed at a baker’s, who has the
reputation for making excellent rolls, forty-eight
pounds of dough moulded into one
hundred (penny) rolls; they weighed, when
drawn out of the oven, twenty-six pounds.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bread called in this metropolis French
rolls, and French bread, is made precisely
in the same manner, namely, from common
bread dough, but of a less stiff consistence;
they are suffered to rise to a
greater extent than dough intended for
loaf-bread.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Some bakers make rolls and French
bread of a superior kind, for private
families, in the following manner:</p>

<p class='c009'>Put a peck of flour into the kneading
trough, and sift it through a wire sieve,
then rub in three quarters of a pound of
butter, and, when it is intimately blended
with the flour, mix up with it two quarts of
warm milk, a quarter of a pound of salt,
and a pint of yeast; let these be mixed
with the flour, and a sufficient quantity of
warm water to knead it into a dough; suffer
it to stand two hours to prove, and then
mould it into rolls, which are to be placed
on tins, and set for an hour near the fire
or in the proving closet. They are then
put into a brisk oven for about twenty
minutes, and when drawn, the crust is
rasped.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>The cakes, called in this metropolis,
<i>muffins</i> and <i>crumpets</i>, are baked, not in an
oven, but on a hot iron plate.</p>

<p class='c009'>For muffins, wheaten flour is made with
water, or milk, into a batter or dough.
To a quarter of a peck of flour is usually
added three quarters of a pint of yeast,
four ounces of salt, and so much water (or
milk) slightly warmed, as is sufficient to
form a dough of rather a soft consistence.
Small portions of the dough are then put
into holes, previously made in a layer of
flour, about two inches thick, placed on a
board, and the whole is covered up with a
blanket and suffered to stand near a fire, to
cause the muffin dough to rise. When
this has been effected, the small cakes will
exhibit a semi-globular shape. They are
then carefully transferred on the heated
iron plate to be baked, and when the bottom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>of the muffin begins to acquire a brown
colour, they are turned and baked on the
opposite side.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Crumpets</i> are made of a batter composed
of flour, water (or milk), and a small quantity
of yeast. To one pound of the best
wheaten flour is usually added three table-spoonsful
of yeast. A portion of the liquid
paste, after having been suffered to rise, is
poured on a heated iron plate, and quickly
baked, like pancakes in a frying pan.</p>
<h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Barley Bread.</span></h3>

<p class='c019'>Barley, next to wheat, is the most
profitable of the farinaceous grains, and
when mixed with a small proportion of
wheat flour, may be made into bread.
Barley bread is not spongy, and feels
heavier in the hand than wheaten bread.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>To remedy this defect in part, it is
always best to set the <i>sponge</i> with wheat
flour only, for barley flour does not readily
ferment with yeast, and adding the barley
flour, when the dough is intended to be
made. Bread made in this way requires
to be kept a longer time in the oven than
wheaten bread, and the heat of the oven
should also be somewhat greater; but
barley bread is sometimes made without
the addition of wheaten flour.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suppose a bushel of barley to weigh
fifty-two pounds and a half to be made
into bread; let it be sent to the mill, and
have the bran taken out, which, with what
is lost in grinding and dressing, will probably
reduce it to forty-four pounds. If
the meal be kneaded into dough, with
water, yeast, and salt, suffered to rise,
and then divided into eight loaves, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>thoroughly baked, they will weigh about
sixty pounds, after drawn out of the oven,
and left two hours to cool.</p>

<p class='c009'>Barley bread is eaten by many of the
farmers and labourers in husbandry, also by
the miners in Devonshire and Cornwall.</p>
<h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Mixed Barley Bread.</span></h3>

<p class='c019'>Take four bushels of wheat ground to
form one sort of flour, extracting only a
very small quantity of the coarser bran.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c014'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
Add to it three bushels and a half of barley
flour, mix up the flour into a dough in the
usual manner, with salt, yeast, and warm
water, (See page <a href='#Page_97'>97</a>), let it be divided into
loaves, and put them into the oven made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>hotter than it would be for baking wheaten
bread. Let them remain in the oven three
hours and a half. In Yorkshire, bread made
from a mixture of these grains is esteemed
more wholesome to those who are used to
it, than bread made from wheat alone.</p>

<h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Rye Bread.</span></h3>

<p class='c019'>Rye is a grain whose cultivation is not
much encouraged in this kingdom, but in
the northern parts of Europe it is in very
extensive use as a nourishing food for
mankind. When made into bread alone,
it is of a dark brown colour, and sweetish
taste, and if eat by people unaccustomed
to its use, it is found to have a laxative
effect. In some parts of this kingdom,
a mixture of rye and wheat is reckoned an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>excellent bread. In Yorkshire, bread
made from a mixture of these two grains
is esteemed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following method of making household
rye bread, has been recommended by
the board of agriculture.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c014'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c015' id='f7'>
<p class='c016'><span class='label'><a href='#r7'>7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Account of Experiments tried by the Board of
Agriculture, p. 12.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Suppose a bushel of rye to weigh sixty
pounds, add to it a fourth part, or fifteen
pounds of rice; this when ground
has only the broad bran taken out, which
seldom exceeds four and a half or five
pounds for that quantity; it is thus directed
to be prepared for household rye bread.</p>

<p class='c009'>Take fourteen pounds of the mixed flour,
a sufficient quantity of yeast, salt, and
warm water, and let it be made in a
dough, and baked in the usual way. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>will produce twenty-two pounds weight of
bread, which is a surplus of three pounds
and a half in fourteen pounds, over and
above what is usually produced in the
common process of converting household
wheat flour into bread.</p>
<h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Turnip Bread.</span></h3>

<p class='c019'>A very good turnip bread may be made
by the following process: Let the turnips
be pared and boiled. When they are soft
enough, for being mashed, the greater part
of the water should be pressed out of them,
and they should be mixed with an equal
quantity in weight of wheat flour. The
dough may then be made in the usual
manner, with yeast, salt, and warm water.
It will rise well in the trough, and after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>being kneaded, it may be formed into
loaves, and put into the oven. It requires
to be baked rather longer than ordinary
bread, and when taken from the oven is
equally light and white, rather sweeter,
with a slight but not disagreeable taste of
the turnip. After it has been allowed to
stand twelve hours, this taste is scarcely
perceptible, and the smell is totally lost,
and after an interval of twenty-four hours,
it cannot be known that it has turnips in its
composition, although it has still a peculiar
sweetish taste, but by no means
unpalatable. It keeps for upwards of a
week.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>
  <h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Rice Bread.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Rice, though one of the roughest and
driest of farinaceous vegetables, is converted
by the Americans into a very
pleasant fermented bread. The process is
as follows: The grain is first washed by
pouring water upon it, then stirring it, and
changing the water until it be sufficiently
cleansed. The water is afterwards drawn off,
and the rice, being sufficiently drained,
is put, while yet damp, into a mortar, and
beaten to powder; it is now completely
dried, and passed through a common hair
sieve. The flour, thus obtained, is generally
kneaded with a small proportion of
Indian corn meal, and boiled into a thickish
consistence; or sometimes it is mixed with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>boiled potatoes, and a small quantity of
leaven, or yeast, is added to the mass.
When it has fermented, sufficiently, the
dough is put into pans, and placed in an
oven. The bread made by this process is
light and wholesome, pleasing to the eye,
and agreeable to the taste. But rice flour
will make excellent bread, without the
addition of either potatoes, or any kind of
meal. Let a sufficient quantity of the flour
be put into a kneading trough; and at the
same time let a due proportion of water
be boiled in a cauldron, into which throw
a few handfuls of rice in grain, and boil it
till it break. This forms a thick and viscous
substance, which is poured upon the
flour, and the whole kneaded with a
mixture of salt and yeast; the dough is
then covered with warm clothes, and left
to rise. In the process of fermentation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>this dough, firm at first, becomes liquid as
soup, and seems quite incapable of being
wrought by the hand. To obviate this
inconvenience, the oven is heated while the
dough is rising; and when it has attained
a proper temperature, a tinned box is
taken, furnished with a handle long enough
to reach to the end of the oven; a little
water is poured into this box, which is then
filled with dough, and covered with cabbage
leaves and a leaf of paper. The box
is thus committed to the oven, and suddenly
reversed. The heat of the oven prevents
the dough from spreading, and keeps
it in the form which the box has given it.
This bread is both beautiful and good;
but when it becomes a little stale, loses
much of its excellence. It comes out of the
oven of a fine yellow colour, like pastry
which has yolks of eggs in it. Other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>methods of making rice bread are the
following:</p>

<p class='c009'>1. Boil a quarter of a pound of rice till
it is quite soft; then put it on the back
part of a sieve to drain, and when it is
cool, mix it up with three quarters of a
pound of wheaten flour, a spoonful of
yeast, and two ounces of salt. Let it stand
for three hours, then knead it well, and roll
it in about a handful of wheaten flour, so
as to make the outside dry enough to put it
in the oven. About an hour and a quarter
will bake it, and it will produce one pound
fourteen ounces of very good white bread,
but it should not be cut till it is two days
old. Another way is the following:</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Take half a peck of rice flour, and
one peck of wheaten flour, mix them together
and knead the dough up with a
sufficient quantity of salt, yeast, and warm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>water, as stated in page 97. Suffer it to
ferment, divide it into eight loaves, and
bake them.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Take a peck of rice, boil it over night
till it becomes soft, then put it in a pan, and
the next morning it will be found to have
swelled prodigiously. A peck of potatoes
should now be boiled, skinned, and mashed
into a fine pulp, and while hot, be well
kneaded up with the rice, and a peck of
wheaten flour; a sufficient quantity of
yeast and salt must now be added, and
the dough left in the kneading trough to
prove or ferment; and when well risen it
may be divided into loaves and baked in
the usual way.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>
  <h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Potatoe Bread.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Potatoes, mixed in various quantities,
with flour, make a wholesome, nutritive,
and pleasant bread. Various methods are
employed for preparing the potatoes.</p>

<p class='c009'>1. Pare a peck of potatoes, put them
into a proper quantity of water, and boil
them till they are reduced to a pulp, then
beat them up into a smooth mass with the
water they boiled in, and knead the mass,
with two pecks of wheaten flour, with a
sufficient quantity of yeast and salt, into a
dough; cover it up, and allow it to ferment
like common wheaten bread, then
make it up into loaves and bake them.
Another method is the following:</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Take twelve pounds of the most mealy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>sort of peeled potatoes, boil and press
them through a fine wire sieve, in such a
manner as to reduce the roots, as nearly as
possible, to a state of dry flour. Mix it up
with twenty pounds of wheaten flour; and
of this mixture make, and set the dough in
the same manner as if the whole were
wheaten flour. See page <a href='#Page_97'>97</a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Take three pounds of potatoes, boil,
skin, and mash them, and whilst warm,
bruise them with a spoon, and put them
into a dish before the fire, to let the moisture
evaporate, stirring them frequently,
that no part grows hard; when dry, rub
them as fine as possible and add nine
pounds of wheaten flour, and with a sufficient
quantity of yeast and salt, knead it
up as other dough; lay it a little while
before the fire to ferment, and then divide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>it into loaves and bake them in a very hot
oven. Another method is the following:</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Boil and peel the potatoes as for eating,
reduce them without any water to a
fine meal or stiff paste. Add to two parts
by weight of the paste, one part of potatoe
starch, and half a part of wheaten flour,
and having added to it salt and yeast,
suffer it to ferment; mould the dough
into loaves, and bake them in the usual
manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>M. Parmentier found, from a variety of
experiments, that good bread might be
made from a mixture of raw potatoe-pulp
and wheaten meal, with the addition of
yeast and salt; and Dr. Darwin asserts,
that if eight pounds of good raw potatoes be
grated into cold water, and after stirring
the mixture the starch be left to subside,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>and when collected, mixed with eight
pounds of boiled potatoes, the mass will
make as good bread as that from the best
wheaten flour.</p>
<h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Potatoe Rolls.</span></h3>

<p class='c019'>Bruise four pounds of boiled and skinned
potatoes, with as much milk as will just
produce a mass, which readily may be
squeezed through a cullender, add this
mass to wheaten flour paste of a middling
stiffness, obtained from six pounds of
wheaten flour; put it before a fire to rise,
make it into rolls, and bake them in a
quick oven. The rolls thus made will be
more porous and light than common rolls.</p>

</div>

<p class='c019'>M. Duduit de Maizieres, a French officer
of the king’s household, has invented and
practised with great success, a method
of making bread of common apples, very
far superior to potatoe bread. After having
boiled one third of peeled apples, he
bruised them, while quite warm, into two-thirds
of flour, including the proper quantity
of yeast, and kneaded the whole without
water, the juice of the fruit being quite
sufficient. When this mixture had acquired
the consistency of paste, he put it into a
vessel, in which he allowed it to rise for
about twelve hours. By this process he
obtained a very excellent bread, full of eyes,
and extremely palatable and light.</p>

  <h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Domestic Oven for Baking Bread.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>The <a href='#oven'>figure on the title page</a> exhibits a
convenient culinary oven for families who
bake their own bread. It is usually erected
on one side of the kitchen fire-place, and
heated by a flue that passes from the fire-grate
under the bottom of the oven. Although
this is in many respects a convenient
and neat way of heating the oven, yet the
manner of managing the fire renders it
only economical in families where a large
fire is always kept up in the kitchen-grate.
In small families it is far more economical
to heat the oven by means of a separate
fire-place built underneath it. A fire-place
six inches wide, nine inches long,
and six inches deep, is sufficient to heat an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>oven eighteen inches wide, twenty-four
inches long, and from twelve to fifteen
inches high, which is a convenient size for
the baking of bread. The grate should be
placed at least twelve inches below the
bottom of the oven when the fuel employed
is pit-coal; and, in order to prevent the
fire from operating with too much violence
upon any part of the oven, the brick-work
should be sloped outwards and upwards on
every side, from the top of the burning
fuel, to the ends and sides of the bottom of
the oven, that the whole may be exposed
to the direct rays of the fire. If the fire-place
be built in this manner, and properly
managed, it is almost incredible how small
a quantity of fuel will answer for heating
the oven, and keeping it hot. In this small
fire-place there is always a very strong
draft of air passing into it, and this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>circumstance, which is unavoidable, renders
it necessary to keep the fire-place
door constantly closed, and to leave but a
small opening, for the passage of the air,
through the ash-pit. If these precautions
are neglected, the fuel will be consumed
very rapidly, the bottom of the oven will
be burnt, and the oven get chilled as
soon as the fire-place ceases to be filled
with burning fuel. In an oven of this
description, I have baked two loaves, each
weighing five pounds, and fifteen rolls
weighing two pounds, by means of half a
peck (ten pounds) of coal.</p>

<p class='c009'>The figures on the plate facing the titlepage[See <a href='#TNs'>Note</a>]
exhibit an oven to be heated with pit-coal
for baking bread, now generally
employed in this metropolis.</p>

<p class='c009'>The oven from which this design has been
made, is eight feet wide, and seven deep.
The fire-place, called by the bakers, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>furnace, for heating the oven, is placed
at the side, and enters the oven diagonally;
it is furnished with a grate, ash holes, and
iron door, similar to a common fire-place
for heating a boiler, but having a partition
to separate it from the oven, and to allow
the fire to enter into the oven; it, therefore,
forms a canal, by which the flame is directed
into the oven. Over the fire-place or furnace
is erected, and lets into the brick-work, a
boiler furnished with a pipe, to supply warm
water as occasion may require.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the oven is required to be heated,
the boiler is filled with water, and the fire
being kindled in the furnace, the flame passes
into the oven, and the smoke escapes into
the chimney.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sides of the oven are nearly straight,
and turned as sharp as possible at the
shoulder, for this form has been found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>better calculated to retain the heat than any
other.</p>

<p class='c009'>The flues to carry off the smoke is over
the entrance door, as shown by the dotted
line <i>a</i> of the figure here exhibited, exhibiting
the plan of the oven.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>A piece of cast iron covers the space
before the door of the oven, exactly level
with its floor; the opening underneath is
applied to no particular use, but is generally
made a receptacle for coal.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Fig. 1</i>, is an <i>elevation</i> of the oven.
The mouth is closed with a cast iron door,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>in which is a small sight-hole with a slide
valve. To heat the oven, the door is thrown
back, and a <i>blower</i> is applied to the mouth,
so contrived, as not only to cover the mouth
of the oven completely, but to enclose also
the throat of the chimney; by this contrivance
the draft is quickly so much increased,
that the oven becomes speedily
heated, and if at anytime it is too hot, it is only
necessary to throw open the door of the fire
place, and to put up the <i>blower</i> for a few
minutes; the current of cool air which is thus
made to pass through it, soon lowers the
heat to the temperature required. In the
<i>blower</i> is also an opening of the same kind
as that in the oven door, which may be
opened and shut at pleasure; the course of
the flue is described by the dotted lines

space is filled with sand, which is well trod
down and shaped to the shape which it is
intended the crown of the oven shall be of.
When the upper work is finished, the sand
is dug out at the mouth of the oven.</p>

  <h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Popular Errors concerning the Quality of Bread.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>The great advantage of eating pure and
genuine bread must be obvious. Every
part of the wheat, which may be called
flour, was not only intended to be eaten by
man, but it really makes the best bread.
The delusion, however, by which so many
persons are misled to think that even the
whole flour is not good enough, obliges
them to pay much dearer for their bread
than they need, to gratify a perverted and
fanciful appetite. Had it not been for the
custom of eating whiter bread than the
whole of the <i>flour</i> can make, the miller and
baker would not have employed their art to
render the bread as white as possible, and
to make the consumer pay for the artificial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>whiteness. The average quantity of flour,
from an unvaried series of experiments,
made from age to age, through the course
of many hundred years, appears to be three-fourth
parts in weight of the whole grain
of wheat, taking all wheats together, being
more in the finer sorts, and less in the
coarser; and the bread made from this
flour has always been deemed the standard
of the food of bread corn. But, by insensible
degrees, the manufacture of bread
became separated into two distinct employments.</p>

<p class='c009'>In consequence of this alteration, the
baker, having no further connexion with
the market for corn, became dependant
solely on the mealman for supplying him
with flour, who, not considering himself
amenable to the then existing assize laws,
made different kinds of flour, some extremely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>fine and white, while others were
very coarse and unpalatable. These artificial
whites, when made into bread, were
so pleasing to the eye and taste, that, in
the course of a few years, they got into
such general use that the people refused
any longer to purchase the bread made of
the whole of the grain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Our forefathers<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c014'><sup>[8]</sup></a> never <i>refined</i> so
much: they never preyed so much on each
other; nor, I presume, made so many laws
necessary for their restraint, as we do.”</p>

bread, comprehending the heart of the wheat with all

health and plenty, preserving infants from the

also Important considerations upon the act of the
thirty-first of George II. relative to the assize of bread.
London: T. Becket, Strand, 1768.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>“In looking back, for some hundred years,
it appears that they adopted a certain plan,
supposing that nature had given nothing
in vain, and that every part of the wheat
which may be called flour, was not only
intended to be eaten by <i>men</i>, but that it
really made the best bread, as that might
be called the <i>best</i>, which is best adapted to
general use, and in itself so fine, as to
contain no parts of the coat, or husks of
grain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The inference which I mean to draw
from what is premised, is to remind my
fellow citizens of the unfortunate delusion
of thinking that even the <i>whole flour</i> of the
wheat is not good enough for <i>them</i>; that
part of it must be taken away, and given
to <i>birds</i> or <i>beasts</i>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“By this delusion, supposing a certain
quantity of wheat appropriated to their use,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>(and this is the view they should see it in,)
they lose one third part of the flour, and
consequently have so much the less bread
to supply their wants.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it not then monstrous to hear them
complain? Is it not absurd to talk of
poverty, and yet pay a <i>seventh</i> or <i>eighth
part</i> more than they need, to gratify a
fantastic appetite? Had it not been from
the custom of eating whiter bread than
the whole flour of the wheat will make,
should we have thus imposed on ourselves?
Would the miller or baker employ all his
art to make the bread as <i>white</i> as possible,
and oblige us to pay for this <i>artificial</i>
whiteness? They tell the consumer, the
<i>whiter it is</i>, the <i>finer</i>; and the finer, the
more nutritive. Thus we become <i>dupes</i> so
far as to overlook the essential good properties
of genuine bread, made of all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>flour of the wheat, and likewise the difference
in the price.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are taught to favour a gross delusion
at the suggestion of interested persons,
against our own substantial welfare. It is
the interest of every one to be <i>honest</i>, and
say nothing contrary to his real sentiments,
as it is the duty of those who have knowledge,
to inform such as are ignorant. Those
who have never eaten bread of all the flour
in a pure state, with the native taste of
wheat, and the moisture which it preserves,
can know nothing of the comparative
excellence of it with respect to the whitened
city bread which they have been accustomed
to eat all their lives.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The dictates of the understanding will
ever yield to the pleasures of the imagination:
and the provident will be attentive
to take the advantage of the extravagant.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Thus it happens that the poor have been
bewildered, and deprived of the object they
sought.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The event depends on the good sense of
masters and mistresses of families, and
their right understanding of what they
mean to eat, <i>that is</i>, of what parts of the
wheat the bread they consume is made.
If they are satisfied that the bread is more
pure than what they used to eat, and
<i>sufficiently fine</i>, we may presume, if they
are in their right minds, they will prefer it
for domestic use. Every family of fourteen
or fifteen persons, consuming at the rate of
one pound each, in a day, pays near 16<i>s.</i> a
week: if they can save 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> or 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> it
is an object: to a poor man who spends 5<i>s.</i>
in bread, if he can save eight or ten pence,
it may purchase two or three pounds of
animal substance towards making one feast
in a week.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>“In regard to the patriotic miller, he
does not pretend to consult our good in
preference to his own; on the contrary,
he reasons very deeply, as if it were best
for us to live on the essence of a leg of
mutton, brought within the compass of a
pint, than feed on such porterly food as
the mutton prepared in the ordinary way of
roasting or boiling. He maintains, that
the finer the bread, though the quantity be
smaller, the more nutritive.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The wheaten bread, of the London
baker, is acknowledged to be whitened by
a mixture of alum, which serves to keep
the loaf in better shape, renders it the
whiter, and causes it to imbibe the more
water to increase the quantity of the
bread. Thus he consults his interest,
without regard to the consumer: the
whiter it is, the more adulterated; and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>as constant experience proves, such bread,
after it is two days old, becomes dry and
husky.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If bread, made in a private family, of
the same flour as the baker uses, will not
be so white, we must suppose that there is
an art of whitening; and that this would
be no secret, if it were not pernicious.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The bread recommended, made of all
the flour of the wheat, retains all the good
properties of bread; it is eatable at the
distance of eight or ten days: is it not on
this account the most eligible?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take a loaf of the wheaten London
bread, made by the baker in his usual way;
let the same baker make another with all
the flour of the wheat, without any attempt
to whiten or otherwise adulterate it.
Let him keep both in the same temperature
of air, and produce a specimen of each at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>any reasonable distance of time, and it
will be easily seen what the difference is.
This arises not only from <i>mixtures</i>, but the
<i>peculiar manner of raising the sponge</i>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In regard to the difference of consuming
new bread of the first day, and
that which has been made for three, four,
or five days, it is computed to be at least a
fourth part. If our present wheaten bread
cannot be eaten with pleasure beyond the
second day, it is not wonderful to discover
at last that we are lighting our candle at
both ends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That the vitiated bread agrees with
some people, whether by the force of habit,
or the mixtures it contains, is not disputed;
but in general it is very hurtful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great numbers of our fellow-subjects
eat their bread much coarser than the
Londoners: are they weaker? they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>generally stronger. Some part of the advantage
must be carried to this account.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let us have time to subdue our prejudices,
and we shall find that bread of all
the flour of the wheat, for the general use,
is better both in quality and price than the
present wheaten bread.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In regard to the <i>London baker</i>, ask
him of what parts of the wheat his bread is
made, and he frankly acknowledges he
cannot tell; and how should he? He can
buy only what is to be sold; and the
quality is not ascertained with any such
precision as to enable him to answer the
question. He, <i>poor man</i> does the best he
can, not to give a sweet wholesome aliment,
but something which is <i>white</i>. He
knows that bread made of a proper proportion
of the wheat, not only differs in
colour, but is moister at the end of eight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>days than <i>his</i> the third day; he likewise
knows that it is sweeter, and has the
native grateful flavour of the wheat, as the
God of Nature hath given it, and not as it
hath been adulterated.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If the parliament had required us to eat
plum-cake, seed-cake, or sugar-cake, we
should have known that plums, seed, and
sugar, constituted the difference; but from
the moment the law made distinctions in
the division of the flour for three different
kinds of bread for common use, we were
exposed to the mercy of the miller to
give the baker what he pleased, and call
it by what name he pleased; we could
only judge whether the bread pleased us or
not. The miller and the baker divide and
subdivide; and instead of flour for bread,
and the bran that remained, according to
ancient practice, whereby the beggar as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>well as the prince was pleased, <i>bread</i>
became a mystery, and we no longer knew
what we were eating.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Our misfortune, in regard to bread, is,
that we eat it too fine; we decline the use
of barley in bread, having hardly enough
for beer. Oats and pease are rejected:
at length we reject even <i>wheaten flour</i>,—unless
we are supplied with the finest
parts only!—What will befall us in the
end?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Custom</i> often makes a law more forcible
than <i>Law-givers</i>, and we have now to
contend with <i>custom</i>.—The first consideration
should be, that the <i>flour</i> which
represents <i>three-fourths of the wheat</i>, shall
be really such, and brought to market in
sacks, marked <i>Standard</i>: the value of it
may be more easily ascertained, than that
of which is made the wheaten bread we now
eat.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>“The baker may be a little the more
reluctant to come into this salutary proposal,
as knowing that if he is to decline
the use of alum, flour that is in any degree
musty, or made of wheat that has grown
or vegetated before gathered in, as sometimes
happens, he cannot work it up so
advantageously in the bread now proposed
to be made, as in the wheaten bread.—Be
this as it may, as soon as the baker finds
this <i>standard</i> flour is vendable in bread, he
will buy it; and knowing what part of the
wheat it ought to be, he will work it into
bread with so much the more satisfaction;
and being sensible that we mean to eat
<i>genuine</i> bread, he will cease to <i>whiten</i> it by
any hurtful art. We shall all understand
what we eat, and the trade will be familiar
to us; we shall be so much happier as we
become so much the more honest, and more
healthy than we were before. Such is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>serious light in which I see the subject
before me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Every occupation hath its mystery; and
the professors are gratified in thinking
themselves wiser than the rest of the world
in their own way. Every professed <i>cook</i>
of the first rate can melt down a large ham
into the contents of half a pint. The
confectioner uses bitter almonds, which
are poisonous; the oilman colours his
pickles with <i>copper</i>, to render them green;
and the baker uses alum to <i>whiten</i> his
bread, and make his flour imbibe the
more water, by which he makes the more
bread out of the same quantity of flour.
This, and other <i>occasional</i> mixtures of the
flour of different grains, renders his bread
husky, dry, and disagreeable the third
day.—Are we the <i>better</i> for any such
mysteries?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>“Whether the wheat be all of one kind,
or <i>married</i>, which is the phrase for mixing
of wheats of different kinds, it will be easy
for people of condition, by experiment,
or by the comparison with genuine bread
made in their families, to know whether
justice be done; though we may easily
discover that the baker for the <i>public</i>, is
generally a better master of his trade than
most housewives are. The <i>mystery</i> may
be thus developed; our health and pleasure
promoted; and our bread be as much
cheaper than it is now, as the gain on the
<i>flour</i> will make it, by using <i>all</i> that the
wheat produces.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Every one may try by grinding and
bolting his own grain, and baking his own
bread, and the manufacturers of bread may
find nearly as good account in bread of all
<i>the flour</i>, which can be so easily ascertained;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>as they do in the wheaten, which is
involved in difficulties.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The public have administered to their
own delusion, their eyes are shut to their
own advantage. If the wealthy will adopt
the use of the bread in question, the labouring
part of our fellow-subjects will certainly
follow the example; and as to <i>paupers</i>, they
will gladly comply.”</p>

  <h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Economical Application of Yeast.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>It frequently happens, in the summer
season, that the brewers, in order to render
their beer less liable to spoil, use more hops
than usual; the consequence of which is,
that the yeast becomes very bitter, and gives
a disagreeable flavour to the bread. To
obviate this inconvenience, Mr. Stone has
recommended the following method of raising
a bushel of flour with only a tea-spoonful
of yeast.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suppose a bushel of flour be put it into
the kneading trough, then take about three
quarters of a pint of warm water, and one
tea-spoonful of yeast. Stir it in till it is
thoroughly mixed with the water; and
make a hole in the middle of the flour, large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>enough to contain two gallons of water.
Pour in the yeast and add some of the
flour until it is a thick liquid paste; strew
some of the dry flour over it, and let it stand
an hour. Then take a quart more of warm
water, and pour it in: in about an hour
it will be seen that the small quantity of
yeast has raised the mixture so, that it will
break through the dry flour placed over it;
and when the warm water has been added,
take a stick and stir in more flour until it
is as thick as before; then shake again
some dry flour over it, and leave it for two
hours more, the mass will rise and break
through the dry flour again; you may then
add three quarts or a gallon of water, and
stir in the flour, and make it into a soft
paste, taking care to cover it with dry flour
again, and in about three or four hours
more the dough may be mixed up, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>covered up warm; and in four or five hours
more it may be made up into loaves, and
put in the oven; and in this manner may
be produced as light a bread as though a
pint of yeast had been used. It does
not take above a quarter of an hour
more than the usual way of baking, for
there is no time lost but that of adding the
water at three or four times. The author
of this method assures us that he constantly
bakes in this way. In the morning, about
six or seven o’clock, he puts the flour in
the trough, and mixes up the spoonful of
yeast with the warm water; in an hour’s
time he adds more flour, in two hours,
again more, and about noon makes up the
dough, and about six in the evening it is put
into the oven: he has always good bread.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>
  <h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Economical Preparation of Yeast.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>The following economical method of
making yeast is recommended by Dr. Lettsom.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thicken two quarts of water with four
ounces of fine flour, boil it for half an hour,
then sweeten it with three ounces of brown
sugar; when almost cold, pour it with four
spoonfuls of baker’s yeast into an earthen
jug, deep enough for the fermentation to
go on without running over; place it for a
day near the fire, then pour off the thin
liquor from the top, shake the remainder,
and close it up for use, first straining it
through a sieve. To preserve it sweet,
set it in a cool cellar, or hang it some depth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>in a well. Keep always some of this to make
the next quantity of yeast that is wanted.
Mr. I. Kerby recommends the following
method of obtaining yeast from potatoes.</p>
<h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Potatoe Yeast.</span></h3>

<p class='c019'>Boil potatoes of the mealy sort, till they
are thoroughly soft, skin and mash them
very smooth, and put as much hot water on
them as will make a mash of the consistency
of common beer yeast, but not thicker.
Add to every pound of potatoes, two ounces
of treacle, and when just warm, stir in for
every pound of potatoes, two large spoonfuls
of yeast. Keep it warm till it has
done fermenting, and in twenty-four hours
it will be fit for use. A pound of potatoes
will make near a quart of yeast, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>has been found to answer the purpose so
well, as not to be able to distinguish the
bread made with it, from bread made with
brewer’s yeast.</p>
<h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter">Method of Preserving Yeast.</span></h3>

<p class='c019'>When yeast is plentiful, take a quantity
and work it well with a whisk until it becomes
thin; then procure a large wooden
dish or platter, clean and dry, and with a
soft brush lay a thin layer of yeast on the
dish, and turn the top downwards to keep
out the dust, but not the air, which is to
dry it. When the first coat is dry, lay on
another, and let that dry, and so continue
till the quantity is sufficient; by this means
it may soon be made two or three inches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>thick, when it may be preserved in dry tin
canisters or stopped bottles, for a long
time, good. When used for baking, cut a
piece off and dissolve it in warm water,
when it will be fit for use.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Accum seems determined that even the outside of his
book shall awaken our fears. The cover of our copy bears a
death’s head emblazoned upon a pall, and, underneath, the motto
“there is death in the pot.” The pall is supported by the
point of a dart. Four other darts support the four corners of the
device. Twelve serpents, with forked tongues and tails entwined,
form a terrific wreath around; while the middle is occupied
with a large cobweb, delineated with much attention to detail, in
the centre of which a spider, full as large as a moderate sized
hazel nut, and so frightful that more than one young lady of our
acquaintance would think it necessary to scream at the sight of
it, holds in its envenomed fangs an ill-fated fly, which is sinking
under the loss of blood, and buzzing in the agonies of death.</p>

<p class='c009'>We are by no means desirous to raise or maintain a popular
clamour; but Mr. Accum certainly advances some weighty
charges, and his work comes with an advantage in bearing a
name not unknown to the scientific world. Of the adulterations
specified, some are deleterious, and others merely fraudulent.
Accordingly, we shall offer a few extracts, both from the original
matter of Mr. Accum, and from his citations drawn from previous
authors.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Among the number of substances used in domestic economy which are now
very generally found sophisticated, may be distinguished,—tea, coffee, bread,
beer, wine, spirituous liquors, salad oil, pepper, vinegar, mustard, cream, and
other articles of subsistence. Indeed it would be difficult to mention a single
article of food which is not to be met with in an adulterated state. And there
are some substances which are scarcely ever to be procured genuine.” (P. 3.)</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>But we pass on from the general statements at the beginning of
the work to particulars.</p>

<p class='c009'>Water, by standing in leaden reservoirs, acquires a highly
deleterious property.</p>

<p class='c009'>In some particular cases, the consequences have been most
fatal.</p>

<p class='c028'>“‘A gentleman was the father of a numerous offspring, having had one and
twenty children, of whom eight died young, and thirteen survived their parents.
During their infancy, and indeed <i>until they had quitted the place of their usual
residence, they were all remarkably unhealthy</i>, being particularly subject to
disorders of the stomach and bowels. The father, during many years, was paralytic;
the mother, for a long time was subject to cholics and bilious obstructions.’”
(P. 78, 79.)</p>

<p class='c009'>These effects were traced to a leaden pump, in the cylinder of
which there were found several perforations, while the cistern
“was reduced to the thinness of common brown paper, and was
full of holes like a sieve.” (P. 79.)</p>

<p class='c009'>We now come to the adulteration of wine; to many of our
readers, probably, a far more interesting concern than that of
water.</p>

<p class='c028'>“All persons moderately conversant with the subject are aware, that a portion
of alum is added to young and meagre red wines, for the purpose of brightening
the colour; that Brazil-wood, or the husks of elderberries and bilberries,
are employed to impart a deep rich purple tint to red port of a pale, feint colour;
that gypsom is used to render cloudy white wines transparent; that an additional
astringency is imparted to immature red wines by means of oak-wood
sawdust, and the husks of filberts, and that a mixture of spoiled foreign and
home-made wines is converted into the wretched compound frequently sold in
this town by the name of <i>genuine old Port</i>.... A <i>nutty</i> flavour is produced
by bitter almonds; fictitious Port wine is flavoured with a tincture drawn from
the seeds of raisins, and the ingredients employed to form the <i>bouquet</i> of high-flavoured
wines, are sweet brier, orris-root, clary, cherry-laurel-water, and
elder flowers. The flavouring ingredients used by manufacturers, may all be
purchased by those dealers in wine who are initiated in the mysteries of the
trade. And even a manuscript receipt-book for preparing them, and the
whole mystery of managing all sorts of wines, may be obtained on payment of
a considerable fee.” (P. 95, 97.)</p>

<p class='c028'>“The particular and separate department in this factitious wine-trade, called
<i>crusting</i>, consists in lining the interior surface of empty wine bottles, in part,
with a red crust of super-tartrate of potash, by suffering a saturated, hot solution
of this salt, coloured with a decoction of Brazil-wood, to chrystallize
within them.” (P. 101, 102.)</p>

<p class='c009'>But the crusting is not confined to the bottle.</p>

<p class='c028'>“A correspondent operation is performed on the wooden cask; the whole
interior of which is stained artificially with a chrystalline crust of super-tartrate
of potash, artfully affixed in a manner precisely similar to that before stated.
Thus the wine-merchant, after bottling off a pipe of wine, is enabled to impose
on the understanding of his customers, by taking to pieces the cask, and exhibiting
the beautiful dark-coloured and fine chrystalline crust, as an indubitable
proof of the age of the wine; a practice by no means uncommon to flatter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>the vanity of those who pride themselves in their acute discrimination of wines.”
(P. 103, 104)</p>

<p class='c009'>This our readers will excuse, for it is pleasing to read of impositions
which are practised on the sagacious. But, says Mr.
Accum,</p>

<p class='c028'>“Several well-authenticated facts have convinced me, that the adulteration
of wine with substances deleterious to health is certainly practised oftener than
is, perhaps, suspected.” (P. 104, 105.)</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently follows the story of the passengers by the coach,
who dined at Newark. Half a bottle of port made them all ill,
one dangerously. Part of the other half caused the death of an
inhabitant of the place, on whom an inquest was held, and a
verdict returned, of—<i>Died by poison</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>A gentleman having been taken severely ill on two successive
days, after drinking each day a pint of Madeira from the same
bottle, his apothecary ordered that it should be examined.</p>

<p class='c028'>“‘The bottle happened to slip out of the hand of the servant, disclosed a
row of shot wedged forcibly into the angular bent-up circumference of it. On
examining the beads of shot, they crumbled into dust, the outer crust (defended
by a coat of black lead with which the shot is glazed) being alone unacted on,
whilst the remainder of the metal was dissolved. The wine, therefore, had
become contaminated with <i>lead and arsenic</i>, the shot being a compound of
these metals, which no doubt had produced the mischief.’” (P. 113, 114.)</p>

<p class='c009'>For detecting the presence of lead or any other deleterious
metal in wine, Mr. Accum recommends the <i>wine test</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>We now come to that part of the subject, which, as <i>some persons</i>
have thought, <i>is merely the business of ale-drinkers</i>, and
their brethren, the porter-drinkers.</p>

<p class='c028'>“The fraud of imparting to porter and ale an intoxicating quality by narcotic
substances, appears to have flourished during the period of the late French
war. For, if we examine the importation lists of drugs, it will be noticed that
the quantities of cocculus indicus imported in a given time prior to that period,
will bear no comparison with the quantity imported in the same space of time
during the war, although an additional duty was laid upon this commodity.
Such has been the amount brought into this country in five years, that it far exceeds
the quantity imported during twelve years anterior to the above epoch.
The price of this drug has risen within these ten years from two shillings to
seven shillings the pound.... It was at the period to which we have alluded
that the preparation of an extract of cocculus indicus first appeared, as a new
saleable commodity, in the price-currents of <i>brewers’ druggists</i>. It was at the
same time also that a Mr. Jackson, of notorious memory, fell upon the idea of
brewing beer from various drugs, without any malt and hops. This chemist
did not turn brewer himself, but he struck out the more profitable trade of
teaching his mystery to the brewers for a handsome fee. From that time forward,
written directions and receipt books, for using the chemical preparations
to be substituted for malt and hops, were respectively sold. And many adepts
soon afterwards appeared every where to instruct brewers in the nefarious
practice first pointed out by Mr. Jackson. From that time, also, the fraternity
of brewers’ chemists took its rise. They made it their chief business to send</p>
<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>travellers all over the country with lists and samples exhibiting the price and
quality of the articles manufactured by them for the use of brewers only. Their
trade spread far and wide, but it was amongst the country brewers chiefly that
they found the most customers. And it is among them up to the present day,
as I am assured by some of these operators, on whose veracity I can rely, that
the greatest quantities of unlawful ingredients are sold.” (P. 157-160.)</p>

<p class='c009'>Part of these evils the porter-drinkers bring upon themselves.</p>

<p class='c028'>“One of the qualities of good porter, is, that it should bear a <i>fine frothy
head</i>, as it is technically termed: because professed judges of this beverage,
would not pronounce the liquor excellent, although it possessed all other good
qualities of porter, without this requisite.—To impart to porter this property of
frothing when poured from one vessel into another, or to produce what is also
termed a <i>cauliflower head</i>, the mixture called <i>beer-heading</i>, composed of common
green vitriol (sulphate of iron) alum and salt, is added. This addition to
the beer is generally made by the publicans.” (P. 182, 183.) It is added in a
note:—”’Alum gives likewise a smack of age to beer, and is penetrating to
the palate.’—<i>S. Child on Brewing</i>, p. 18.” “The great London brewers, it
appears, believe that the publicans alone adulterate the beer.” (P. 211.)</p>

<p class='c028'>“Capsicum and grains of paradise, two highly acrid substances, are employed
to give a pungent taste to weak insipid beer. Of late, a concentrated
tincture of these articles, to be used for a similar purpose, and possessing a
powerful effect, has appeared in the price-currents of brewers’ druggists.
Ginger root, coriander seed, and orange peels, are employed as flavouring
substances chiefly by the ale brewers.” (P. 184, 185.)</p>

<p class='c009'>We find the following articles, in a list of illegal ingredients,
seized at various breweries and brewers’ druggists.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Multum, 84 lbs.; cocculus indicus, 12 lbs.; colouring, 4 galls; honey, about
180 lbs.; hartshorn shavings, 14 lbs.; Spanish juice, 46 lbs.; orange powder,
17 lbs.; ginger, 56 lbs.; grains of paradise, 44 lbs.; quassia, 10 lbs.; liquorice,
64 lbs.; carraway seeds, 40 lbs.; multum, 26 lbs.” “Capsicum, 88 lbs.; copperas,
310 lbs.; colouring and drugs, 84 lbs.; mixed drugs, 240 lbs.; coriander seed,
2 lbs.; beer colouring, 24 gallons.” (P. 186-189.) [The list which includes
these articles is copied from the minutes of the committee of the House of
Commons.]</p>

<p class='c009'>Some of the substances above enumerated may be thought
comparatively harmless. But others are absolutely poisonous.</p>

<p class='c028'>“To increase the intoxicating quality of beer, the deleterious <i>vegetable</i> substance,
called <i>cocculus indicus</i>, and the extract of this poisonous berry, technically
called <i>black extract</i>, or by some, <i>hard multum</i>, are employed. Opium,
tobacco, nux vomica, and extracts of poppies, have also been used.—This fraud
constitutes by far the most censurable offence committed by unprincipled brewers.
And it is a lamentable reflection to behold so great a number of brewers
prosecuted, and convicted of this crime. Nor is it less deplorable to find the
names of druggists, eminent in trade, implicated in the fraud, by selling the unlawful
ingredients to brewers for fraudulent purposes.” (P. 205, 206.)</p>

<p class='c009'>Then follows a list of thirty-four convictions of brewers, for
receiving or using illegal ingredients.—We perfectly agree with
the following observations.</p>

<p class='c028'>“That a minute portion of an unwholesome ingredient, daily taken in beer,
cannot fail to be productive of mischief, admits of no doubt: and there is reason
to believe that a small quantity of a narcotic substance (and cocculus indicus is</p>
<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>a powerful narcotic), daily taken into the stomach, together with an intoxicating
liquor, is highly more efficacious than it would be without the liquor. The
effect may be gradual; and a strong constitution, especially if it be assisted
with constant and hard labour, may counteract the destructive consequences
perhaps for many years. But it never fails to show its baneful effects at last.”
(P. 209, 210.)</p>

<p class='c009'>We now come to the business of another small portion of the
community, namely, the <i>tea-drinkers</i>. Perhaps the following
descriptions will assist them in forming a diagnosis.</p>

<p class='c028'>“All the samples of spurious green tea (nineteen in number) which I have
examined, were coloured with carbonate of copper, (a poisonous substance),
and not by means of verdigrise, or copperas.” (P. 240.) “Mr. Twining
asserts, that ‘the leaves of spurious tea are boiled in a copper, with copperas
and sheep’s dung.’” (P. 240. Note.) “Tea rendered poisonous by carbonate
of copper, speedily imparts to liquid ammonia, a fine sapphire blue tinge. It is
only necessary to shake up in a stopped vial, for a few minutes, a tea-spoonful
of the suspected leaves, with about two table-spoonsful of liquid ammonia,
diluted with half its bulk of water. The supernatant liquid will exhibit a fine
blue colour, if the minutest quantity of copper be present. Green tea, coloured
with carbonate of copper, when thrown into water impregnated with sulphuretted
hydrogen gas, immediately acquires a black colour. Genuine green tea,
suffers no change from the action of these tests.” (P. 241.)</p>

<p class='c009'>The following extracts may perhaps prove interesting to
<i>brandy-drinkers</i>.</p>

<p class='c028'>“‘It is a custom among retailing distillers, which I have not taken notice of
in this directory, to put one third or one fourth part of proof molasses brandy,
proportionably, to what rum they dispose of; which cannot be distinguished,
but by an extraordinary palate, and does not at all lessen the body or proof of
the goods; but makes them about two shillings a gallon cheaper; and must be
well mixed and incorporated together in your retailing cask. But you should
keep some of the best rum, not adulterated, to please your customers, whose
judgment and palate must be humoured.—When you are to draw a sample of
goods to show a person that has judgment in the proof, do not draw your goods
into a phial to be tasted, or make experiment of the strength thereof that way,
because the proof will not hold except the goods be exceedingly strong. But
draw the pattern of goods either into a glass from the cock, to run very small,
or rather draw off a small quantity into a little pewter pot, and pour it into your
glass, extending your pot as high above the glass as you can without wasting
it, which makes the goods carry a better head abundantly, than if the same
goods were to be put and tried in a phial.—You must be so prudent as to make
a distinction of the persons you have to deal with. What goods you sell to
gentlemen for their own use, who require a great deal of attendance, and as
much for time of payment, you must take a considerably greater price than of
others; what goods you sell to persons where you believe there is a manifest,
or at least some hazard of your money, you may safely sell for more than common
profit; what goods you sell to the poor, especially medicinally, (as many
of your goods are sanative), be as compassionate as the cases require.—All
brandies, whether French, Spanish, or English, being proof goods, will
admit of one pint of <i>liquor</i>‘ (<i>water</i>) ‘to each gallon, to be made up and incorporated
therewith in your cask, for retail, or selling smaller quantities. And
all persons that insist upon having proof goods, which not one in twenty understand,
you must supply out of what goods are not so reduced, though at a
higher price.’” (P. 267-270.)</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>Some of the adulterations of spirituous liquors are exceedingly
pernicious.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Another method of fining spirituous liquors, consists in adding to it, first, a
solution of sub-acetate of lead, and then a solution of alum. This practice is
highly dangerous, because part of the sulphate of lead produced, remains dissolved
in the liquor, which it thus renders poisonous.” (P. 284.) “The
cordial called shrub frequently exhibits vestiges of copper.” (P. 285.)</p>

<p class='c009'>Gloucester Cheese has been found contaminated with red lead.
The article used in colouring cheese is anotto. In one instance,
the anotto, being inferior, had been coloured with vermilion;
and the vermilion adulterated by a druggist, (who little thought
that it would ever enter into the composition of cheese,) with red
lead. The account of the whole transaction as given by Mr.
Accum, is worth reading, but too long to be extracted.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cayenne pepper, “is sometimes adulterated with red lead, to
prevent its becoming bleached on exposure to light.” (P. 305.)
Pickles “are sometimes intentionally coloured by means of copper.”
(P. 306.) “Mrs. E. Raffald directs, ‘to render pickles
green, boil them with halfpence, or allow them to stand twenty-four
hours in copper or brass pans.’” (P. 309.) “Vinegar is
sometimes largely adulterated with sulphuric acid, to give it
more acidity.” (P. 311.) “Red sugar drops are usually
coloured with the inferior kind of vermilion. This pigment is
generally adulterated with red lead. Other kinds of sweetmeats
are sometimes rendered poisonous by being coloured with preparations
of copper.” (P. 315, 316.) “The foreign conserves
... are frequently impregnated with copper.” (P. 317.)
“Quantities” of catsup “are daily to be met with, which on a
chemical examination, are found to abound with copper.” (P.
319.) “The quantity of copper which we have more than once
detected in this sauce, used for seasoning, and which, on account
of its cheapness, is much resorted to by people in the lower
walks of life, has exceeded the proportion of lead to be met with
in other articles employed in domestic economy.” (P. 320.)
“The leaves of the cherry-laurel, <i>prunus laurocerasus</i>, a
poisonous plant,” are used to flavour custards, <i>blanc-mange</i>, and
other delicacies of the table. (P. 324.) An instance is given
of the dangerous consequences of this practice. (P. 325, 326.)
“The water distilled from cherry-laurel leaves is frequently
mixed with brandy and other spirituous liquors.” (P. 327.) Several
samples of anchovy sauce “have been found contaminated
with lead.” (P. 328.) It is not unusual to employ, in preparing
this sauce, “a certain quantity of Venetian red, added for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>the purpose of colouring it, which, if genuine, is an innocent
colouring substance. But instances have occurred of this pigment
having been adulterated with orange lead, which is nothing
else than a better kind of minimum or red oxid of lead.” (P,
328, 329.) In lozenges, “the adulterating ingredient is usually
pipe-clay, of which a liberal portion is substituted for sugar.”
(P. 330.) Dr. T. Lloyd says, “‘I was informed,’” (at a
<i>respectable</i> chemist’s shop in the city) “‘that there were two
kinds of ginger lozenges kept for sale, the one at three-pence
the once, and the other at six-pence; and that the article furnished
to me by mistake was the cheaper commodity. The
latter were distinguished by the epithet <i>verum</i>, they being composed
of sugar and ginger only. But the former were manufactured
partly of white Cornish clay, with a portion of sugar
only, with ginger and Guinea pepper. I was likewise informed,
that of Tolu lozenges, peppermint lozenges, and ginger pearls,
and several other sorts or lozenges, two kinds were kept; that
the <i>reduced</i> prices, as they were called, were manufactured for
those very clever persons in their own conceit, who are fond of
haggling, and insist on buying better bargains than other people,
shutting their eyes to the defects of an article, so that they
can enjoy the delight of getting it cheap: and, secondly, for
those persons, who being but bad paymasters, yet as the manufacturer,
for his own credit’s sake, cannot charge more than the
usual price of the article, he thinks himself therefore authorized
to adulterate it in value, to make up for the risk he runs, and
the long credit he must give.’” (P. 332, 333.)</p>

<p class='c009'>Well—there is then some honesty left in the world. What a
pleasure it is to have to deal with a <i>respectable</i> man. But we
return to the practices of the <i>knaves</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Olive oil “is sometimes contaminated with lead.” (P. 334.)
The dealers in this commodity assert that lead or pewter “prevents
the oil from becoming rancid. And hence some retailers
often suffer a pewter measure to remain immersed in the oil.”
(P. 336.) “The beverage called soda water is frequently contaminated
both with copper and lead.” (P. 351.) Mr. Johnston,
of Greek Street, Soho, was the first who pointed out the danger
to the public. “Many kinds of viands are frequently impregnated
with copper, in consequence of the employment of cooking
utensels made of that metal. By the use of such vessels in
dressing food, we are daily liable to be poisoned.” (P. 352.)
“Mr. Thiery, who wrote a thesis on the noxious quality of copper,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>observes that ‘our food receives its quantity of poison, in
the kitchen by the use of copper pans and dishes. The brewer
mingles poison in our beer, by boiling it in copper vessels.
The sugar-baker employs copper pans. The pastry-cook bakes
our tarts in copper moulds. The confectioner uses copper vessels.
The oilman boils his pickles in copper or brass vessels,
and verdigrise is plentifully formed by the action of the vinegar
upon the metal.’” (P. 353, 354.) Moreover, “various kinds
of food, used in domestic economy, are liable to become impregnated
with lead.” (P. 359.)</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Accum, speaking on the subject of Beer, says,</p>

<p class='c028'>“It will be noticed that some of the sophistications are comparatively harmless,
whilst others are affected by substances deleterious to health.” (P. 185.)</p>

<p class='c028'>We think, however, that the candour of Mr. Accum leads him to make too
much allowance for this consideration throughout. Surely, though many articles
of food be not absolutely poisonous, a diet consisting of drugs and chemical
compounds and articles never intended by nature to be eaten or drunk, articles
for which, presented simple, the hungriest stomach would feel no appetite or
inclination, cannot be wholesome. Brick and mortar are not poison; yet we
cannot, like the dragon of Wantley, swallow a church, and pick our teeth with
the steeple. Many can eat oysters, but few could manage the oyster-knife.
Even the Welshman of King Arthur’s court, fond as he was of toasted cheese,
would inevitably have been choked by the mouse that ran down his throat to
eat it, had he not “pulled him out by the tail.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We could give farther extracts; but must refer the reader to
the work itself, which contains much interesting matter, besides
what we have selected. THE MONEY THAT IS OFTEN
LAID OUT IN THE PURCHASE OF COOKERY BOOKS,
WHICH TEACH THE ART OF EXCITING DISEASE AND

    <div>THERE IS DEATH IN THE POT.</div>
    <div class='c000'>II. KINGS—CHAP. VI. VERSE XI.</div>
    <div class='c000'>(<i>From Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine, No. XXXV. Page 542.</i>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Accum, it appears, is
one of those very good-natured
friends, who is quite resolved
not to allow us to be cheated
and poisoned as our fathers
were before us, and our children
will be after us, without
cackling to us of our danger,
and opening our eyes to
abysses of fraud and imposition,
of the very existence of
which we had until now the
good fortune to be entirely ignorant.
His book is a perfect
death’s head, a memento mori,
the perusal of any single chapter
of which is enough to throw
any man into the blue devils
for a fortnight. Mr. Accum
puts us something in mind of
an officious blockhead, who,
instead of comforting his dying
friend, is continually jogging
him on the elbow with such
cheering assurances as the following.
“I am sorry there is
no hope; my dear fellow, you
must kick the bucket soon.
Your liver is diseased, your
lungs gone, your bowels as impenetrable
as marble, your legs
swelled like door-posts, your
face as yellow as a guinea, and
the doctor just now assured me
you could not live a week.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Accum’s work is evidently
written in the same spirit
of dark and melancholy anticipation,
which pervades Dr.
Robison’s celebrated “Proofs
of a Conspiracy, &amp;c. against
all the crowned heads of Europe.”
The conspiracy disclosed
by Mr. Accum is certainly
of a still more dreadful
nature, and is even more widely
ramified than that which excited
so much horror in the worthy
professor. It is a conspiracy
of brewers, bakers, grocers,
wine-merchants, confectioners,
apothecaries, and cooks, against
the lives of all and every one of
his majesty’s liege subjects.
It is easy to see that Mr.
Accum’s nerves are considerably
agitated, that—</p>

<p class='c028'>“Sad forebodings shake him as he writes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Not only at the festive board is
he haunted by chimeras dire
of danger—not only does he
tremble over the tureen—and
faint over the flesh-pot: but
even in his chintz night-gown,
and red morocco slippers, he is
not secure. An imaginary
sexton is continually jogging
his elbow as he writes, a death’s
head and cross bones rise on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>his library table; and at the
end of his sofa he beholds a
visionary tomb-stone of the best
granite—</p>

<p class='c009'>ON WHICH ARE INSCRIBED THE DREADFUL WORDS—</p>

<p class='c009'>Since we read his book, our
appetite has visibly decreased.
At the Celtic club, yesterday,
we dined almost entirely on
roast beef; Mr. Oman’s London-particular
Madeira lost all
its relish, and we turned pale
in the act of eating a custard,
when we recollected the dreadful
punishment inflicted on
custard-eaters, in page 326 of
the present work. We beg to
assure our friends, therefore,
that at the present moment
they may invite us to dinner
with the greatest impunity.—Our
diet is at present quite similar
to that of Parnel’s hermit,</p>

<p class='c009'>“Our food the fruits, our drink the crystal well;”</p>
<p class='c016'>though we trust a few days will
recover us from our panic, and
enable us to resume our former
habits of life. Those of our
friends, therefore, who have
any intention of pasturing us,
had better not lose the present
opportunity of doing so. So
favourable a combination of
circumstances must have been
quite unhoped for on their part,
and most probably will never
occur again.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c014'><sup>[24]</sup></a> V. S.</p>

<div class='footnote c015' id='f24'>
<p class='c016'><span class='label'><a href='#r24'>24</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To save some trouble, we may announce that we are already engaged to
dinner, on the 23d, 27th, and 28th of this month, and to evening parties, on the
22d, 23d, 26th, 28th, and 29th, and 3d of March.</p>
</div>
<p class='c009'>Since, by the publication of
Mr. Accum’s book, an end has
been for ever put to our former
blessed state of ignorance, let
us arm ourselves with philosophy,
and boldly venture to look
our danger in the face; or, as
the poet beautifully expresses
it, in language singularly applicable,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>“Come, Christopher, and leave all meaner things,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Melancholy as the details are,
there is something almost ludicrous,
we think, in the very
extent to which the deceptions
are carried. So inextricably
are we all immersed in this
mighty labyrinth of fraud, that
even the venders of poison
themselves are forced, by a
sort of retributive justice, to
swallow it in their turn.—Thus
the apothecary, who sells
the poisonous ingredients to
the brewer, chuckles over his
roguery, and swallows his own
drugs in his daily copious exhibitions
of Brown stout. The
brewer in his turn, is poisoned
by the baker, the wine-merchant,
and the grocer. And,
whenever the baker’s stomach
fails him, he meets his <i>coup
de grace</i> in the adulterated
drugs of his friend the apothecary,
whose health he has been
gradually contributing to undermine,
by feeding him every
morning on chalk and alum, in
the shape of hot rolls.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our readers will now, we
think, be able to form a general
idea of the perils to which they
are exposed by every meal.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Accum’s details on the
adulteration of wine are extremely
ample, and so interesting,
that we regret our limits
prevent our making more copious
extracts, and oblige us to
refer our readers for farther information
to the work itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having thus laid open to our
view the arcana of the cellar,
Mr. Accum next treats us with
an expose of the secrets of the
brew-house. Verily, the wine-merchant
and brewer are <i>par
nobile fratrum</i>; and after the
following disclosures, it will
henceforth be a matter of the
greatest indifference to us, whether
we drink Perry or Champaigne,
Hermitage or Brown
stout. <i>Latet anguis in poculo</i>,
there is disease and death in
them all, and one is only preferable
to the other, because it
will poison us at about one-tenth
of the expense.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Malt liquors, and particularly
porter, the favourite beverage of the
inhabitants of London and of other
large towns, is amongst those articles,
in the manufacture of which the greatest
frauds are frequently committed.</p>

<p class='c028'>“The practice of adulterating beer
appears to be of early date. To shew
that they have augmented in our own
days, we shall exhibit an abstract from
documents laid lately before Parliament.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Mr. Accum not only amply proves,
that unwholesome ingredients are used
by fraudulent brewers, and that very
deleterious substances are also vended
both to brewers and publicans for
adulterating beer, but that the ingredients
mixed up in the brewer’s enchanting
cauldron are placed above
all competition, even with the potent
charms of Macbeth’s witches:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Accum very properly
gives us a list of those miscreants
who have been convicted
of adulterating their porter
with poisonous ingredients, and
want of room alone prevents us
from damning them to everlasting
fame, by inserting their
names along with that of the
Rev. Sennacherib Terrot, in the
imperishable pages of this miscellany.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Accum gives us a long
dissertation on counterfeit tea,
and another on spurious coffee;
but as these are impositions by
which we are little affected, we
shall not allow them to detain
us. The leaves of the sloe-thorn
are substituted for the former,
and roasted horse beans for the
latter. These frauds, it appears,
are carried to a very
great extent.</p>

<p class='c009'>We must now draw our extracts
to a close; but we can
assure our readers, that we have
not yet introduced them to one
tythe of the poisonous articles
in common use, detected by
Mr. Accum. We shall give
the titles of a few to satisfy
the curious:—Poisonous confectionary,
poisonous pickles,
poisonous cayenne pepper, poisonous
custards, poisonous anchovy
sauce, poisonous lozenges,
poisonous lemon acid, poisonous
mushrooms, poisonous ketchup,
and poisonous soda water!
Read this, and wonder
how you live!</p>

<p class='c009'>While we thus suffer under
accumulated miseries brought
upon us by the unprincipled
avarice and cupidity of others,
it is surely incumbent on us
not wantonly to increase the
catalogue by any negligence or
follies of our own. Will it be
believed, that in the cookery
book, which forms the prevailing
oracle of the kitchens in
this part of the island, there is
an express injunction to “<i>boil
greens with halfpence</i> in order
to improve their <i>colour</i>?”—That
our puddings are frequently
seasoned with laurel leaves,
and our sweetmeats almost uniformly
prepared in copper vessels?
Why are we thus compelled
to swallow a supererogatorary
quantity of poison which
may so easily be avoided?
And why are we constantly
made to run the risk of our
lives by participating in custards,
trifles, and blancmanges,
seasoned by a most deadly poison
extracted from the <i>prunus
lauro-cerasus</i>? Verily, while
our present detestable system
of cookery remains, we may
exclaim with the sacred historian,
that there is indeed
“Death in the Pot.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>It is curious to see how vice varies its forms, and maintains
its substance, in all conditions of society;—and how certainly
those changes, or improvements as we call them, which diminish
one class of offences, aggravate or give birth to another.—In
rude and simple communities, most crimes take the shape of
violence and outrage—in polished and refined ones, of Fraud.
Men sin from their animal propensities in the first case, and from
their intellectual depravation in the second. The one state of
things is prolific of murders, batteries, rapines, and burnings—the
other of forgeries, swindlings, defamations, and seductions.
The sum of evil is probably pretty much the same in both—though
probably greatest in the civilized and enlightened stages;
the sharpening of the intellect, and the spread of knowledge,
giving prodigious force and activity to all criminal propensities.</p>

<p class='c009'>Among the offences which are peculiar to a refined and enlightened
society, and owe their birth, indeed, to its science and
refinement, are those skilful and dexterous adulterations of the
manifold objects of its luxurious consumption, to which their
value and variety, and the delicacy of their preparation, hold
out so many temptations; while the very skill and knowledge
which are requisite in their formation, furnish such facilities for
their sophistication. The very industry and busy activity of
such a society, exposes it more and more to such impostures;—and
by the division of labour which takes place, and confines
every man to his own separate task, brings him into a complete
dependence on the industry of others for a supply of the most
necessary articles.</p>

<p class='c009'>The honesty of the dealer, and of the original manufacturer, is
the only security to the public for the genuineness of the article
in which he deals. The consumer can in general know nothing
of their component parts; he must take them as he finds them;
and, even if he is dissatisfied, he has in general no effectual
means of redress.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>It will be found, that as crimes of violence decrease with the
progress of society, frauds are multiplied; and there springs up
in every prosperous country a race of degenerate traders and
manufacturers, whose business is to cheat and to deceive; who
pervert their talents to the most dishonest purposes, prefering
the illicit gains thus acquired to the fair profits of honorable
dealing; and counter-working, by their sinister arts, the general
improvement of society.</p>

<p class='c009'>In almost every branch of manufacture, there are fraudulent
dealers, who are instigated by the thirst of gain, to debase the
articles which they vend to the public, and to exact a high price
for what is comparatively cheap and worthless. After pointing
out various deceptions of this nature, Mr. Accum, the ingenious
author of the work before us, proceeds in his account of those
frauds, in the following terms.</p>

<p class='c028'>‘Soap used in house-keeping is frequently adulterated with a considerable
portion of fine white clay, brought from St. Stephen’s in Cornwall. In the manufacture
of printing paper, a large quantity of plaster of Paris is added to the
paper stuff, to increase the weight of the manufactured article. The selvage of
cloth is often dyed with a permanent colour, and artfully stitched to the edge of
cloth dyed with a fugitive dye. The frauds committed in the tanning of skins,
and in the manufacture of cutlery, and jewellery, exceed belief.’ pp. 27-29.</p>

<p class='c009'>What is infinitely worse, however, than any of those frauds,
sophistications, we are informed, are carried on to an equal extent
in all the essential articles of subsistence or comfort. So
long as our dishonest dealers do not intermeddle with these
things, their deceptions are comparatively harmless; the evil in
all such cases amounting only to so much pecuniary damage.
But when they begin to tamper with food, or with articles connected
with the table, their frauds are most pernicious: in all
cases the nutritive quality of the food is injured, by the artificial
ingredients intermixed with it; and when these ingredients, as
frequently happens, are of a poisonous quality, they endanger
the health and even the life of all to whom they are vended.
We cannot conceive any thing more diabolical than those
contrivances; and we consider their authors in a far worse light
than ordinary felons, who, being known, can be duly guarded
against. But those fraudulent dealers conceal themselves under
the fair show of a reputable traffic—they contrive in this manner
to escape the infamy which justly belongs to them—and, under
the disguise of wealth, credit, and character, to lurk in the bosom
of society, wounding the hand that cherishes them, and scattering
around them poison and death.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>It is chiefly for the purpose of laying open the dishonest
artifices of this class of dealers, that Mr. Accum has published
the present very interesting and popular work; and he gives a
most fearful view of the various and extensive frauds which are
daily practised on the unsuspecting public.</p>

<p class='c028'>‘Among the number of substances used in domestic economy, which are now
very generally found sophisticated, may be distinguished—tea, coffee, bread,
beer, wine, spirituous liquors, salad oil, pepper, vinegar, mustard, cream, and
other articles of subsistence.—Indeed, it would be difficult to mention a single
article of food which is not to be met with in an adulterated state; and there are
some substances which are scarcely ever to be procured genuine.—Some of these
spurious compounds are comparatively harmless when used as food; and as, in
these cases, merely substances of inferior value are substituted for more costly
and genuine ingredients, the sophistication, though it may affect our purse, does
not injure our health. Of this kind are the manufacture of factitious pepper,
the adulterations of mustard, vinegar, cream, &amp;c. Others, however, are highly
deleterious; and to this class belong the adulterations of beer, wines, spirituous
liquors, pickles, salad oil, and many others.’ pp. 2-4.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are, it appears, particular chemists who make it their
sole employment to supply the unprincipled brewer of porter and
ale with drugs, and other deleterious preparations; while others
perform the same office to the wine and spirit merchant, as well
as to the grocer and oilman—and these illicit pursuits have
assumed all the order and method of a regular trade.</p>

<p class='c028'>‘The eager and insatiable thirst for gain’ (Mr. Accum justly observes),
which seems to be a leading characteristic of the times, calls into action every
human faculty, and gives an irresistible impulse to the power of invention;
and where lucre becomes the reigning principle, the possible sacrifice of a
fellow-creature’s life is a secondary consideration.’</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Accum having exhibited this general view of his subject,
proceeds to enter into an examination of the articles most commonly
counterfeited, and to explain the nature of the ingredients
used in sophisticating them. He commences with a dissertation
on the qualities of good water, in which he briefly points out the
dangerous sophistications to which it is liable, from the administration
of foreign ingredients.</p>

<p class='c009'>But in the case of water, the adulteration is purely accidental,
which cannot be said of the other articles specified by Mr. Accum.
In the making of Bread, more especially in London, various
ingredients are occasionally mingled with the dough. To suit
the caprice of his customers, the baker is obliged to have his
bread light and porous, and of a pure white. It is impossible to
produce this sort of bread from flour alone, unless it be of the
finest quality. The best flour, however, being mostly used by
the biscuit-bakers and pastry-cooks, it is only from the inferior
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>sorts that bread is made; and it becomes necessary, in order to
have it of that light and porous quality, and of a fine white, to
mix alum with the dough. Without this ingredient, the flour
used by the London bakers would not yield so white a bread as
that sold in the metropolis.</p>

<p class='c009'>Wine appears to be a subject for the most extensive and
pernicious frauds.</p>

<p class='c028'>‘All persons (Mr. Accum observes) moderately conversant with the subject,
are aware, that a portion of alum is added to young and meagre red wines, for
the purpose of brightening their colour; that Brazil wood, or the husks of elderberries
and bilberries, which are imported from Germany, under the fallacious
name of <i>berry-dye</i>, are employed to impart a deep rich purple tint to red port of
a pale colour; that gypsum is used to render cloudy white wines transparent;
that an additional astringency is imparted to immature red wines by means of
oak-wood and sawdust, and the husks of filberts; and that a mixture of spoiled
foreign and home-made wines is converted into the wretched compound frequently
sold in the metropolis by the name <i>genuine old Port</i>.’</p>

<p class='c009'>Other expedients are resorted to, in order to give flavour to
insipid wines. For this purpose bitter almonds are occasionally
employed; factitious port wine is also flavoured with a tincture
drawn from the seeds of raisins; and other ingredients are frequently
used, such as sweet brier, orris root, clary, cherry-laurel
water, and elder flowers.</p>

<p class='c009'>In London, the sophistication of wine is carried to an enormous
extent, as well as the art of manufacturing spurious wine, which
has become a regular trade, in which a large capital is invested;
and it is well known that many thousand pipes of spoiled cider
are annually sent to the metropolis for the purpose of being converted
into an imitation of port wine.</p>

<p class='c009'>Innumerable are the tricks practised to deceive the unwary, by
giving to weak, thin, and spoiled wines, all the characteristic
marks of age, and also of flavour and strength. In carrying on
these illicit occupations, the division of labour has been
completely established; each has his own task assigned him
in the confederate work of iniquity; and thus they acquire
dexterity for the execution of their mischievous purposes. To
one class is allotted the task of <i>crusting</i>, which consists in lining
the interior surface of empty wine bottles with a red crust.
This is accomplished by suffering a saturated hot solution of
super-tartrate of potash, coloured red with a decoction of Brazil
wood to chrystallize within them. A similar operation is frequently
performed on the wooden cask which is to hold the
wine, and which, in the same manner as the bottle, is artificially
stained with a red crust; and on some occasions, the lower extremities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>of the corks in wine bottles are also stained red, in
order to give them the appearance of having been long in contact
with the wine. It is the business of a particular class of wine-coopers,
by means of an astringent extract mixed with home-made
and foreign wines, to produce ‘genuine old port,’ or to give an
artificial flavour and colour to weak wine; while the mellowing
and restoring of spoiled white wines is the occupation of another
class called refiners of wine. Other deceptions are practised by
fraudulent dealers, which are still more culpable. The most
dangerous of these is where wine is adulterated by an admixture
of lead.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Accum justly observes, that the ‘merchant or dealer who
practises this dangerous sophistication, adds the crime of murder
to that of fraud, and deliberately scatters the seeds of disease
and death among those customers who contribute to his emolument.’</p>

<p class='c009'>Spirituous liquors, which in this country form one of the chief
articles of consumption, are subjects of equally extensive fraud
with wine. The deceptions which are practised by the dealers
in this article, are chiefly confined to fraudulent imitations of the
peculiar flavour of different sorts of spirits; and as this flavour
constitutes, along with the strength, the value of the spirit, the
profit of the dealer consists in imitating this quality at a cheaper
rate than it is produced in the genuine spirit. The flavour of
French brandy is imitated, by distilling British molasses spirit
over wine lees; previous to which, however, the spirit is deprived
of its peculiar disagreeable flavour, by rectification over fresh-burnt
charcoal and quicklime. This operation is performed by
those who are called brewers’ druggists, and forms the article in
the <i>prices-current</i> called <i>Spirit Flavour</i>. Wine lees are
imported into this country for the purpose, and they pay the
same duty as foreign wines. Another method of imitating the
flavour of brandy, which is adopted by brandy merchants, is by
means of a spirit obtained from raisin wine, after it has begun
to become somewhat sour. ‘Oak sawdust,’ (Mr. Accum
observes), ‘and a spirituous tincture of raisin stones, are likewise
used to impart to new brandy and rum a <i>ripe taste</i>, resembling
brandy or rum long kept in oaken casks, and a somewhat oily
consistence, so as to form a durable froth at its surface, when
strongly agitated in a vial. The colouring substances are burnt
sugar, or molasses; the latter gives to imitative brandy a luscious
taste, and fulness in the mouth.’ Gin, which is sold in small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>quantities to those who judge of the strength by the taste, is
made up for sale by fraudulent dealers with water and sugar;
and this admixture rendering the liquor turbid, several expedients
are resorted to, in order to clarify it; some of which are harmless,
while others are criminal. A mixture of alum with subcarbonate
of potash, is sometimes employed for this purpose; but more
frequently, in place of this, a solution of subacetate of lead, and
then a solution of alum,—a practice reprobated by Mr. Accum
as highly dangerous, owing to the admixture of the lead with
the spirit, which thereby becomes poisonous. After this operation,
it is usual to give a false appearance of strength to the
spirit by mixing with it grains of paradise, guinea pepper,
capsicum, and other acrid and aromatic substances.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the manufacture of malt liquors, a wide field is opened for
the operations of fraud. The immense quantity of the article
consumed, presents an irresistible temptation to the unprincipled
dealer; while the vegetable substances with which beer is
adulterated, are in all cases difficult to be detected, and are frequently
beyond the reach of chemical analysis. There is, accordingly,
no article which is the subject of such varied and extensive
frauds. These are committed in the first instance by the brewer,
during the process of manufacture, and afterwards by the dealer,
who deteriorates, by fraudulent intermixtures, the liquor which
he sells to the consumer. ‘The intoxicating qualities of porter
(he continues) are to be ascribed to the various drugs intermixed
with it;’ and, as some sorts of porter are more heady than others,
the difference arises, according to this author, ‘from the greater
or less quantity of stupifying ingredients’ contained in it. These
consist of various substances, some of which are highly deleterious.
Thus, the extract disguised under the name of <i>black
extract</i>, and ostensibly destined for the use of tanners and
dyers, is obtained by boiling the berries of the <i>cocculus indicus</i>
in water, and converting, by a subsequent evaporation, this
decoction into a stiff black tenacious mass, possessing in a high
degree the narcotic and intoxicating quality of the poisonous
berry from which it is prepared. Quassia is another substance
employed in place of hops, to give the beer a bitter taste; and
the shavings of this wood are sold in a half torrified and ground
state, in order to prevent its being recognised.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not only is the use of all these deleterious substances strictly
prohibited to the brewer under severe penalties, but all druggists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>or grocers convicted of supplying him with any of them,
or who have them in their possession, are liable to severe penalties;
and Mr. Accum gives a list of twenty-nine convictions for
this offence, from the year 1812 to 1819. From the year 1813
to 1819, the number of brewers prosecuted and convicted of
using illegal ingredients in their breweries, amounts to thirty-four.
Numerous seizures have also been made during the same
period at various breweries, and in the warehouses of brewers’-druggists,
of illegal ingredients, to be used in the brewing of
beer, some of them highly deleterious.</p>

<p class='c009'>Malt liquors, after they are delivered by the brewer to the
retail-dealer, are still destined to undergo various mutations
before they reach the consumer. It is a common practice with
the retailers of beer, though it be contrary to law, to mix table-beer
with strong beer; and, to disguise this fraud, recourse is
had to various expedients. It is a well known property of genuine
beer, that when poured from one vessel into another, it
bears a strong white froth, without which professed judges would
not pronounce the liquor good. This property is lost, however,
when table-beer is mixed with strong beer; and to restore it, a
mixture of what is called <i>beer-heading</i> is added, composed of
common green vitriol, alum, and salt. To give a pungent taste
to weak insipid beer, capsicum and grains of paradise, two
highly acrid substances, are employed; and, of date, a concentrated
tincture of these articles has appeared for sale in the
prices-current of brewers’-druggists. To bring beer forward,
as it is technically called, or to make it hard, a portion of sulphuric
acid is mixed with it, which, in an instant, produces an
imitation of the age of eighteen months; and stale, half-spoiled,
or sour beer, is converted into mild beer, by the simple admixture
of an alkali or an alkaline earth; oyster-shell powder, and
subcarbonate of potash, or soda, being usually employed for
that purpose. In order to show that these deceptions are not
imaginary, Mr. Accum refers to the frequent convictions of
brewers for those fraudulent practices, and to the seizures
which have been made at different breweries of illegal ingredients—a
list of which, and of the proprietors of the breweries
where they were seized, he has extracted from the Minutes of
the Committee of the House of Commons, appointed to Inquire
into the Price and Quality of Beer. It may be observed,
that while some of the sophistications of beer appear to be perfectly
harmless, other substances are frequently employed for this
purpose which are highly deleterious, and which must gradually
undermine the health of those by whom they are used.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>Many other of the most ordinary articles of consumption
are mentioned by our author as being the object of the most
disgusting and pernicious frauds. Tea, it is well known, from
the numerous convictions which have lately taken place, has
been counterfeited to an enormous extent; and copper, in one
form or another, is the chief ingredient made use of for effecting
the imitation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The practice of adulterating coffee, has also been carried on
for a long time, and to a considerable extent, while black and
white pepper, Cayenne pepper, mustard, pickles of all sorts,
have been all of them debased by an admixture of baser, and,
in many cases, poisonous ingredients. Ground pepper is frequently
sophisticated by an admixture from the sweepings of the pepper
warehouses. These sweepings are purchased in the market
under the initials P. D., signifying pepper dust. ‘An inferior
sort of this vile refuse (Mr. Accum observes), or the sweepings
of P. D., is distinguished among venders by the abbreviation
of D. P. D., denoting dust, or dirt of pepper dust.’</p>

<p class='c009'>Of those various frauds so ably exposed in Mr. Accum’s
work, and which are so much the more dangerous, as they are
committed under the disguise of an honourable trade, it is impossible
to speak in terms of too strong reprobation; and in
the first impulse of our indignation, we were inclined to avenge
such iniquitous practices by some signal punishment. We naturally
reflect, that such offences, in whatever light they are
viewed, are of a far deeper dye than many of those for which
our sanguinary code awards the penalty of death—and we wonder
that the punishment hitherto inflicted, has been limited to
a fine. If we turn our view, however, from the moral turpitude
of the act, to a calm consideration of that important question,
namely,—What is the most effectual method of protecting
the community from those frauds?—we will then see strong
reasons for preferring the lighter punishment. We do not find
from experience, that offences are prevented by severe punishments.
On the contrary, the crime of forgery, under the most
unrelenting execution of the severe law against it, has grown
more frequent. As those, therefore, by whom the offence of
adulterating articles of provision is committed, are generally
creditable and wealthy individuals, the infliction of a heavy fine,
accompanied by public disgrace, seems a very suitable punishment:
and if it be duly and reasonably applied, there is little
doubt that it will be found effectual to check, and finally to root
out, those disgraceful frauds.</p>

    <div class='c000'>(<i>From the Literary Gazette, No. CLVI. 1820.</i>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>One has laughed at the whimsical
description of the cheats
in Humphrey Clinker, but it is
really impossible to laugh at
Mr. Accum’s exposition. It is
too serious for a joke to see
that in almost every thing which
we eat or drink, we are condemned
to swallow swindling,
if not poison—that all the items
of metropolitan, and many of
country consumption, are deteriorated,
deprived of nutritious
properties, or rendered
obnoxious to humanity by the
vile arts and merciless sophistications
of their sellers. So
general seems the corruption,
and so fatal the tendency of
most of the corrupting materials,
that we can no longer
wonder at the prevalence of
painful disorders, and the
briefness of existence (on an
average) in spite of the great
increase of medical knowledge,
and the amazing improvement
in the healing science, which
distinguish our era. No skill
can prevent the effects of daily
poisoning; and no man can
prolong his life beyond a short
standard, where every meal
ought to have its counteracting
medicine.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Accum acts the part of
Dionysius with us; only the
horse-hair by which he suspends
the sword over our heads
allows the point gradually to
enter the flesh, and we do not
escape, like Damocles, with
the simple fright: yet it is
but justice to acknowledge,
that in almost every case he
furnishes us with tests whereby
we can ascertain the nature
of our danger; and no man
could do more towards enabling
us to mitigate or escape from
it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Advising our readers to abstain
from perusing the annexed
synopsis till after they have
dined, that they may have one
more meal in comfort ere they
die, we proceed to the various
heads under which the author
ranges his dread array.</p>

<p class='c009'>Devoted to disease by baker,
brewer, grocer, &amp;c. the physician
is called to our assistance;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>but here again the pernicious
system of fraud, as it
has given the blow, steps in to
defeat the remedy.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is so horribly pleasant to
reflect how we are in this way
be-swindled, be-trayed, be-drugged,
and be-devilled, that
we are almost angry with Mr.
Accum for the great service he
has done the community by
opening our eyes, at the risk
of shutting our mouths for ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>His account of water is so
fearful, that we see there is no
wisdom in the well; and if we
then fly to wine, we find, from
his analysis, that there is no
truth in that liquid: bread
turns out to be a crutch to
help us onward to the grave,
instead of the staff of life; in
porter there is no support, in
cordials no consolation; in almost
every thing poison, and
in scarcely any medicine, cure.</p>

<p class='c009'>The work contains a great
many excellent observations on
the various sorts of water, and
the modes of conveying and
preserving them for use: it appears
generally that leaden
pipes and cisterns, and copper
vessels are highly dangerous.</p>

<p class='c009'>Good heavens! we think we
hear it exclaimed, is there no
end to these infamous doings?
does nothing pure or unpoisoned
come to our tables, except
butcher’s meat, which has been
rendered far less nutritive than
formerly, by new methods of
feeding? Why, we must answer,
hardly any thing: for our author
proceeds to shew that <i>cheese</i>
(Gloucester he mentions) has
been contaminated with red
lead, a deadly poison mixed
with the colouring anotto, when
that article was scarce: that
<i>pepper</i> is adulterated with factitious
pepper-corns “made up
of oil-cakes (the residue of
lint-seed, from which the oil
has been pressed), common
clay, and a portion of Cayenne
pepper, formed in a mass, and
granulated by being first pressed
through a sieve, and then
rolled in a cask;” and further,
that “ground pepper is very
often sophisticated by adding
to a portion of genuine pepper,
a quantity of pepper dust, or
the sweepings from the pepper
warehouses, mixed with a little
Cayenne pepper. The sweepings
are known, and purchased
in the market, under the name
of P.D. signifying pepper dust.
An inferior sort of this vile
refuse, or the sweepings of P.D.
is distinguished among vendors
by the abbreviation D.P.D,
denoting, dust (dirt) of pepper
dust.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As we read on, we learn
the method of manufacturing
adulterated vinegar, adulterated
cream, adulterated lozenges,
adulterated mustard, adulterated
lemon acid, poisonous
Cayenne, poisonous pickles,
poisonous confectionary, poisonous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>catsup, poisonous custards,
poisonous anchovy sauce,
poisonous olive oil, poisonous
soda water; and, if not done to
our hands, of rendering poisonous
all sorts of food by the
use of copper and leaden vessels.
Suffice it to record, that
our pickles are made green by
copper; our vinegar rendered
sharp by sulphuric acid; our
cream composed of rice powder
or arrow root in bad milk; our
comfits mixed of sugar, starch,
and clay, and coloured with
preparations of copper and
lead; our catsup often formed
of the dregs of distilled vinegar
with a decoction of the
outer green husk of the walnut,
and seasoned with all-spice,
cayenne, pimento, onions, and
common salt—or if founded on
mushrooms, done with those in
a putrefactive state remaining
unsold at market; our mustard
a compound of mustard, wheaten
flour, cayenne, bay salt,
raddish seed, turmeric, and
pease flour; and our citric acid,
our lemonade, and our punch,
to refresh or to exhilarate,
usually cheap tartareous acid
modified for the occasion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Against all these, and many
other impositions, Mr. Accum
furnishes us with easy and
certain tests: his work, besides,
contains many curious documents
and useful recipes; and
it is replete with intelligence,
and often guides to the right
while it exposes the wrong.</p>
